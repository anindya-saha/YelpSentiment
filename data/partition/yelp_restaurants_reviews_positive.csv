The weather was perfect which made sitting outside overlooking their grounds an absolute pleasure.  Our waitress was excellent and our food arrived quickly on the semi-busy Saturday morning.  It looked like the place fills up pretty quickly so the earlier you get here the better.Do yourself a favor and get their Bloody Mary.  It was phenomenal and simply the best I've ever had.  I'm pretty sure they only use ingredients from their garden and blend them fresh when you order it.  It was amazing.While EVERYTHING on the menu looks excellent, I had the white truffle scrambled eggs vegetable skillet and it was tasty and delicious.  It came with 2 pieces of their griddled bread with was amazing and it absolutely made the meal complete.

They are probably griping about something that their own fault...there are many people like that.In any case, my friend and I arrived at about 5:50 PM this past Sunday. It was pretty crowded, more than I thought for a Sunday evening and thought we would have to wait forever to get a seat but they said we'll be seated when the girl comes back from seating someone else. We were seated at 5:52 and the waiter came and got our drink orders. Everyone was very pleasant from the host that seated us to the waiter to the server. The prices were very good as well. We placed our orders once we decided what we wanted at 6:02. We shared the baked spaghetti calzone and the small ""Here's The Beef"" pizza so we can both try them. The calzone was huge and we got the smallest one (personal) and got the small 11"" pizza. Both were awesome! My friend liked the pizza better and I liked the calzone better. The calzone does have a sweetish sauce but that's how I like my sauce!We had to box part of the pizza to take it home and we were out the door by 6:42. So, everything was great and not like these bad reviewers. That goes to show you that  you have to try these things yourself because all these bad reviewers have some serious issues.",review,0a2KyEL0d3Yb1V6aivbIuQ,0,0,0

Here's what I've had so far: La Condesa Shrimp Burro and Baja Sur Dogfish Shark Taco.  They are both were very delicious meals but the shrimp burro stole the show.  So much flavor.  I snagged some bites from my hubbys mole and mahi mahi burros- mmmm such a delight.  The salsa bar is endless.  I really stocked up.  I was excited to try the strawberry salsa but it was too hot, in fact it all was, but I'm a big wimp when it comes to hot peppers. The horchata is handmade and delicious.  They throw pecans and some fruit in there too which is a yummy bonus!As if the good food wasn't enough to win me over the art in this restaurant sho did!

So in my preparation to go to this place I ordered Xanax from an on-line Canadian pharmacy, which I have been taking for three days now.  Bought a tazer from Spy Headquarters in case one of them tries to hold me down and pours patchouli oil on me.  The fifth of gin that I slammed in the parking lot really helped with that last bit of extra courage that I needed to partake my journey into hippie-land.It was all for nothing. No hippies around, just a teenager behind the counter.  This place is tiny and the counters are about at mouth level. I don't know how anyone under 7'6"" could easily eat off of them.  Anyways for $5 flat, you get a kick ass burger, a school lunch bag half full of well seasoned skin-on fries, and a can of soda.

When I first hit AZ-88, it had an enormous deconstructed NY taxicab suspended from the ceiling which was a fantastical conversation piece. The wall behind the bar was completely covered in names and numbers. (I was far too proud when I accurately guessed that they were the names of cabbies and the numbers were their license numbers.) Overall, a very different, fun look.Comfortable chairs and very full cocktails abound, and while they typically have a rock-steady delivery, more than a little cosmo has ended up in my friend's purse, to her chagrin. That aside, the food is fantastic and even though it's a bit hard to get out of here for under $30 per person (because you simply must try the cheesecake, and drinks are pushing $14), it's worth it as a classy-but-casual night out that you can really enjoy.They have a great patio, the burger is dripping with flavor (and, in fact, cheese), and they have waffle fries with pretty much everything. Great salads and sandwiches help round things out, and they ship their cheesecake in from Carnegie Deli in New York which is just about the most perfect cheesecake you'll have the good chance to try. Forget that Cheesecake Factory nonsense, these people know how a cheesecake is done. It is rich, thick, with just a hint of sour, and an amazing flavor that takes your tongue hostage and demands whipped cream ransom.Overall, a wonderful place for drinks and good food with friends, and the staff is pointed but efficient and will throw back any shit you give them, in good humor or, as appropriate, not.

Not only did they have stations set up all throughout the restaurant, patio and R-Bar, but they also had an extensive dessert area with build-your-own sundaes, freshly made cotton candy (in an old fashioned cotton candy maker) and a long dessert table with a chocolate fountain. Lunch:Lunch here is sublime and I also enjoy either the tacos or the chicken sandwich. The chicken sandwich is particularly a favorite of mine due to the cheese and sauce. The fries are tasty as well and you can either get sweet potato or regular. I also get sweet potato then regret not just getting the regular which are better in my mind. If the weather permits, sit on the patio and enjoy the beautiful water fountains, views of the mountain and tropical/desert setting.",review,4ozupHULqGyO42s3zNUzOQ,3,7,2

I don't have an office for my agency yet so coffee shops tend to be where I get most of my work done.Last week I checked out Echo Coffee for a client meeting and we both really liked it.  Today I returned and spent a few hours working at Echo Coffee on their wi-fi. It was such a nice break from my usual home office at Starbucks.  Walking into Echo Coffee you can instantly tell its a different type of coffee experience.  The environment is very relaxing, music is not blasting so customers don't have to scream over each other, and they have great big couches in the back.  Of course atmosphere and great coffee needs to be in balance and it definitely was at Echo.The coffee is really good and love very fair price for the quality you get (my 2 favs are Cappuccino at $2.75 and $3.75 for large Chai Latte).  My chai latte came in a big ceramic mug.  I don't know about you but there is just something special enjoying coffee out of big mugs and not recyclable paper cups.A surprising first for me is getting actual lunch at a coffee place and was pleasantly surprised to find the food was also really good.  Can you tell I am a fan yet?  I ordered a Curry Chicken sandwich and it was huge and delicious so finished the whole thing.  There was a nice bonus on the plate - Mango Chutney so make sure you get that if you order lunch at Echo.  I would have loved just a bowl of that and bread as its flavor was so good.  I need to find out where they get this from as I want to have it at home. About $12.50 for my huge Chai tea and curry chicken sandwich.",review,WEuIqh8ygm-bH81s8lwD0g,11,15,5

r3r_bAfa6pZKIhQB82FizQ,2/12/09,-0d1TTyKmgknAYVEDLaqgQ,5,"FINALMENTE!!!Andiamo....FOOD--------Appetizer: Fritto Misto, which is a trio of fried appetizers. For the day, ours included a cheese, a stuffed olive, and whole leaves of broccolini. The cheese wedge was great (I wish I remembered what it was), and have you ever had a deep fried veal-stuffed olive? Very interesting. The flash-fried broccolini took a little getting used to, since the leaves kept crumbling as I was trying to eat them, but still tasty, if subtle.Main: Orecchiette alla Puttanesca. Man. This is the real deal. Orecchiette is the ""little ear"" pasta and ""alla puttanesca"" means it's made ""whore style"". And what a beautiful, classy, yet very vibrant whore she is.The pasta was cooked just perfectly, and even though puttanesca sauce usually goes with a stringier pasta (spaghetti, linguini, etc.) it worked really well with the orecchiette. And the sauce. Holy mother, this streetwalkin' hussy of a sauce with its 12 ingredients: capers, breadcrumbs, anchovy sauce, garlic, olives, basil, olive oil, and, uh, the other 5. The flavors were a perfect, clear-heeled harmony. Nothing overpowered the other. Subtle and humble home food. It really tasted just like something my Italian friends' mothers would cook in their kitchen.As for the servings, when I first got my bowl I was thinking, ""oh ok, this is a European serving. I'm still going to be starving after this."" And, um, nope. Why? Because I slowed down. I savored my meal, and took my time with the dish. And by the end, was I hungry? Not at all. I really enjoyed this meal. And the serving was just right. Complimentary packs of long breadsticks are also found on each table. SERVICE-------------Very friendly, efficient, and willing to go through the menu in detail and answer any more questions about the restaurant. Dishes were brought out in a timely manner and there was never any rush after the meal was completed to clear the table. And the mood inside Pastabar was palpable. Everyone looked happy, excited, and relieved that the restaurant was finally open for business. And I felt the same for them. SETTING-------------I would say the space was just the right size. Not a cavernous place in the least. Probably the same size as Sens, maybe  even a little smaller. It's tucked away in the very back of the hallway of the building, so much so that I completely missed it when I was IN THE HALLWAY the previous afternoon looking for it. But I like it a little hidden off, actually. The colors inside are warm, with a modern bistro feel. No windows looking outside but I didn't mind that. There is seating at the bar, a few two-tops up front, and larger tables in the back. Selections from different Shins albums made up the soundtrack throughout the dinner, and while the music sounds like it could be incongruous with a bunch of little ears cooked whore-style, it worked. I definitely don't think this is going to be as ""scene-y"" as Sens. It has a completely different vibe. EXTRA CRIB NOTES-----------------------------* the main courses of Pastabar are pasta and ONLY pasta. No veal parm here. And no hoikey sauces like Olive Garden-y alfredo or a jar of sugary Prego.* It's great* Prices for antipasti range from $7-$11-ish and mains $11-ish to $18. I spent around $26 with tax and a nice tip.* it's great* No liquor license (yet). For now, sparkling waters, lemonades, a number of sodas (including root beer & cream soda). * it's great* complimentary valet awaits the diners, if you're averse to parking close by yourself.* it's great* It's open till midnight on weeknights and 2 am on weekends! What more could you ask for?* did I tell you it's great?ALL IN ALL---------------An awesome asset to the area and I'm very content. And as much as I loved my whoreish little ears, all the other pastas on the menu sounded incredible and I can't wait to try them all. I'm wishing these guys much success and giving them gratitude to finally being open. A few minor kinks to be worked out (and I wasn't as into the appetizer as I was my entree) so it's not totally perfect but they have started out very strong, and it's only Day 2.And here I was thinking my days of giving out 5 stars were over (ok, more like 4.55 and rounding up)...",review,htC49ZwXiKNka5cp0GKBfQ,17,16,13

You can hardly find ANY kind of Japanese katsu in AZ, yet they have an excellent one that's very traditional, but not too expensive!

Well, to them I say you should educate your tongue, and expose it to some delicious culture! There's also Orange chicken... This dish is completely the bee's knees.

Their fried rice might seem a little ""heavy"" on the surface as it's lightly fried with some garlic oil, but it outclasses all competitors.  Paired with their lightly fried shrimp, it's sweet garlic love.  Seriously, their fried rice is the Sean Connery of fried rices.As I've been eating here for far longer than I'd like to admit, I'd have to say I might be a little biased.

So on Monday, Venyse and I headed to White Chocolate Grill where we both had our cherries popped.We started out with the spinach artichoke dip. The blends of cheeses made this perhaps the single most spectacular dip I've ever had the honor of putting in my mouth. O.M.G. Venyse and I were practically clawing at the bowl to get the last of its creamy loveliness. But when you hit a home run so soon in the game, the rest of a meal can seem at odds.However, I was not daunted. She ordered the New York Strip with a side of mashed potatoes (with good gravy...what exactly is that?) and roasted carrots; I the blackened Mahi [*back story to follow] topped with crab and a side of Israeli couscous. We didn't share our protein, but we sampled each others sides. All were very good, but the carrots really stood out. The gravy and the potatoes were good and I loved my couscous. But halfway through here steak and by the last few bites of my fish, we both hit the wall. A food coma was certain. I persevered but Venyse relented and boxed the rest of her meat and carrots.Then came the white chocolate brownie. So sweet, so rich, so topped with vanilla ice cream. It was all we could to to make a dent in it. We both felt bad, because isn't white chocolate supposed to be their signature ingredient? Regardless, this was a terrific first restaurant to go with which to begin. And we both agreed it would be a place in our future dinner splurges. I also must admit I love LOVE the belt buckles. Having about 42 myself, I was intrigued when I first noticed what I thought read ""SWAG"" after staring for perhaps too long in that general region of one of the staff. (Really super sorry if that creeped you out.) It's actually WCG.[* When a group of us went to Key West one December to escape of the harsh winter of NWOhio and Detroit, we went to a restaurant the listed ""Dolphin"" as one of its menu items.

F8q_9PUl-Lwjj9xIRPArcg,9/7/10,7X9CV9e3PS_q-a_024kosA,5,"Have I got a place for you un-health conscious, frugal foodies out there!  Rocket Burger and Subs serves up huge sandwiches and fried delights for astonishingly low prices, and much of the food is home-made. There's also an enormous section of unusual soft drinks; for instance, there's over two dozen brands of root beer to choose from. Dennis, one of the owners worked for A&W for 8 years, so he probably has root beer running through his veins by now.      I saw Rocket Burger in a listing of new valley eateries, then did a little research. The reviews I saw were all stellar, so I knew we had to give it a try. It doesn't look like much, inside or out - it's in a little strip mall tucked behind Churches Chicken at 35th Ave. and Cactus. But it's clean, and everybody is helpful and pleasant. Ken gave a happy whoop when he saw Cheese Curds ($2.49/$4.49) on the menu. We decided to get an order while waiting for our friends Randy and Marty to join us. The curds came quickly out of the kitchen, piping hot, served with some tasty homemade marinara. They were a touch greasy, as they should be, and the oil was fresh. Marty and Randy arrived in time to save us from ourselves by helping to finish off the curds. Then we took a while trying to make our selections from the extensive menu. Eventually Randy and I both went for the New Yorker: pastrami with homemade slaw and thousand island dressing ($2.99, $3.99 or $4.99). Ken had a homemade-meatball  sub, with more of that good marinara and some provolone. It was the same price structure as our New Yorkers and all the rest of the entries under Classic Subs and Sandwiches. Marty went with a double burger ($3.89, the singles are $1 less). He could have opted for a Rocket Burger - !0 inch sub with three burgers and the fixings in either plain, cheese, bacon, teriyaki, or chili style ($4.99 to $5.99). Of course we had to try the fries and onion rings.     Again our food arrived quickly, served in plastic baskets. It became very quiet, except for the occasional growl of pleasure. The onion rings ($1.99) had been dipped in a thin cornmeal batter which made them nice and crunchy.  The handcut fries ($1.49) were skinny, the way I like them. Randy thought they were undersalted, but I thought they were fine - our usual disagreement. At any rate, they disappeared quickly. Unlike the sandwiches. They were so big that we all ended up taking half of each sub home. The slaw on the New Yorkers was delicious, as was my whole wheat sub roll. The meat balls were nice and tender, and there was plenty of cheese on top. Randy had found a bottle of ginger beer imported from Australia that had a wonderfully refreshing true ginger taste. There seemed to be actual pieces of ginger in it - instructions on the label said to invert the bottle before opening. It never did tell you to turn it right side up again - the Aussies give us more credit than we deserve.      Other food items available: Hebrew National hot dogs in several styles ($2.49), Pizza  Bread with various toppings, Gyros ($3.69), salads ($1.99 - $3.99), a fish sandwich ($2.49) served with homemade tartar sauce.

Don't miss out on taking home some baked goods... the baguettes are crusty-soft and warm when you get them.  The croissants are delicious and some of the better ones here in the valley.  I did try and Avacodo boba...had to send it back...not sure what the heck it was...it was green... but didn't taste anything like Avacado... so I did head across the way to Boba tea house for my bobas.

The food is as awesome as ever. The service is much as it has always been. Be forewarned, trendy restaurant goers, who glom onto TV reviews, Mrs. White's is not trendy; there are no bubbly fresh blonde girls waiting to seat you. The service is matter of fact, no goofing around, you must get to the business of ordering and pretend you know what you are doing - this is the way it has always been at Mrs. White's. If you are looking for others to pamper you, this is not the place for that. Mrs. White's is where you go to pamper your indulgence for perfect soul food. If you want Scottsdale ambiance, again, this joint won't work for you.When you go, be prepared that not all dishes may be on the menu during your visit. There are no corporate owned semi-trailers that deliver two tons of food every other day. This is a small and very cramped operation that makes homemade food for those who know how to appreciate it. In these days of flash frozen prepared dishes that are uniform from visit to visit at chain restaurants, this food is made in a tiny hot kitchen. If they run out of your favorite dish that has been cooking for hours prior to your arrival, there is no way they can whip up another pot of green beans and potatoes in 20 minutes. I often call ahead to verify if they have what I want because years ago it was not uncommon that by 12:30 they would be out of half of everything on the menu, which was OK because if forced me to try new things Back then, Mrs. White's was open Monday through Friday from 11:00 till 3:00, but I'd swear you'd be lucky to get anything after 1:00 - and that was perfectly fine as you knew they were doing all they could with their limited space to do their best for us customers. I'd just come back on another day. To say I have the utmost respect for the White family would be an understatement, today I was afraid I might have to lose that based on those poor reviews below. I do not believe those reviews are an accurate representation of The Golden Rule Cafe. They are the distortions and disappointments of people who have skewed expectations. Funky little hole-in-the-wall family-run operations that attract a loyal customer base may not be the place for everyone, but if you understand that wonderful stuff doesn't always come wrapped in a sterile designer package, then you might get along with Mrs. White's.I love this place and hope I always will.",review,5cVACUA-5e1SYyQ_E2-9iw,2,6,1

You get what you pay for.  We were happily surprised after reading the reviews...the food was amazing, the portions are huge and we had leftovers both times.  (and p.s., we paid with a debit card both times and have had no trouble, despite the review about only paying cash.)Our first visit, we were greeted kindly and given a plate of fruit to munch on until we ordered.  My husband ordered the mint tea and it was delish!  For an appetizer, we had the sabzi...which is a huge plate of green herbs, homemade wheat nan, feta cheese, and walnuts.  The herbs were FRESH and the nan was delicious...just the smell of it was enough to get us drooling!For entrees, we had the spinach herb stew and the vegetable stew with eggplant.  I am currently pregnant and garlic is not something that's agreeing with me.  I asked if the vegetable stew had garlic in it and the waiter said ""we can make it however you want...every dish is made when you order it""....what??  the dishes are made to order??  I haven't heard that at a lot of restaurants!  After about 20 minutes, our stews arrived...steaming hot and smelling delicious.  They were HEAVENLY!  So many flavors and so fresh!!Our second time here, we had the dolmeh plate and Mast Va Mosear (a spinach dip)...both were ok...but I like the Sabzi better.  The entrees we had were amazing...I had a special of the day (pomegranate walnut sauce over tofu, which was blissful to smell and eat) and hubby had the vegetarian sampler to get his falafel fix.Overall, if you are willing to pay a little more for a nice, organic foods dinner, go here and check it out.

Some might call it a fine-dining experience, but clearly this was something more.  A tribute to opulence and Regan-era excess, Dominick's is your seven-figure foodie fantasy come alive; from the moment you enter the swanky foyer to the gleaming 10 inch tower of tiramisu that finishes your meal.  It's glittery, bedazzled, and oozing pretension - and I loved it.The ServiceMy visit to Dominick's was the night after it's official opening.  The service tried very hard to be as impeccable as the surroundings and, while not perfect, the charming staff and the sincere effort put forth made little things like missing napkins and bread plates instantly forgivable.  Our server, Drew, let us know that the wait staff only had 2 - 3 tables each and it was very evident in the personal service we received.  A few more weeks of experience for the staff should easily iron out the little wrinkles.The FoodWe started with the jumbo shrimp appetizer, which unfortunately came with 3 shrimp - hardly conducive to sharing - so we ordered two. And ""Jumbo"" they certainly were, accompanied by a kicky cocktail sauce which my dinner companion felt was spicy enough.  Ever the daredevil, I added additional horseradish to mine because who doesn't like to burn the inside of their nostrils at dinner.For the main course we both had the 9-oz filet, lobster gnocchi and steamed asparagus.  My filet was a perfect rare-plus with a dark pink center, expertly seared and juicy.Surprisingly the lobster gnocchi really stole the show for me.  I'm not big on starches or cream sauces so when it was suggested I wasn't particularly excited; I should have been.  The dough was light and fluffy, the cream sauce not too rich and the lobster added the perfect amount of salt & texture.After dinner I indulged in a grand marnier while my companion ordered the tiramisu.  He was presented with a 10 inch tall hunk of cake that could easily have been intended for 4 people.  The tiramisu was spongy and light, with a lovely cool custard and only a subtle flavor of rum.  A nice finish to an excellent meal.  AtmosphereWe were lucky enough to score a poolside table which started off as very romantic but over the course of the evening became quite the place for people watching.  The scene at the small bar area on the 2nd floor was bustling and both the waiters and I wondered aloud how long it would be before a guest fell in the pool.

Let me be clear. I 'm reviewing Haji Baba as a GROCERY STORE first.  Then I will give you some insight into the prepared food for take-out or in-store dining.This is one of the few stores in Arizona where you have several choices for pita bread--it's also the ONLY place I've found for whole wheat pita.There are several choices for Feta cheese. Danish, French,Greek...same with olives--there are choices.I ALWAYS buy my tahini here. All the prices are very inexpensive.Need spices???  They have them all.  At about 25% of the price you would pay anywhere else.The best way to describe Haji Baba is that it is a REAL grocery store, with REAL prices, for REAL people.  It is NOT a ""specialty store"" with trendy items and inflated prices.  They sell food items that you will actually use.  The bonus here?  You won't find a 10 year old can or jar of something.On to the ""restaurant"" portion.  Haji Baba is better if you think of it as a take-out joint that happens to have places to sit and eat.  They do have tables and they do perform table service, it's just got zero charm.  You go for the food, that's it.Okay, food.  The lamb tongue sandwich is to die for.  Let me repeat.  The LAMB TONGUE PITA SANDWICH.  GET IT!  Their baba ganouj is also darned tootin' tasty.  Actually, I sometimes dream about their baba ganouj.I'm not crazy about their hummus, maybe because making hummus takes 5 minutes and mine is bomb? But it's not bad.Gyros are good and not greasy. Greasy gyro meat is a pet peeve of mine.Chicken shwarma?  Yup, that's good too.I'm sure I've had something  to eat  here that I was a little disappointed in, but I honestly can't remember what, or when.",review,XpSZrY_Ym8GGx7SNEd0q9g,2,3,2

He had a glass of cabernet and I had pinot grigio... and voila - a warm bread basket arrived on our table at just the right time!We were both happy with our orders when they arrived as well... the fish was cooked just right and the sauce was tasty... good portions as well!  Although we were full, we decided to order a dessert to share - the homemade snow white chocolate tartufo - yum!  The perfect sweet ending to our meal.  In addition, we were each brought an after dinner drink of amaretto on the rocks, on the house.****I just have to share that I was pleasantly surprised that the women's restroom was clean, spacious, and had a fresh fragrance to it - I normally don't notice that, but I was impressed by this!In speaking to the waiter and the owner, we learned that this restaurant recently changed locations but they've been in business for over 15 years.

Thinking Asian all day and being an incapable decision maker, I rely on Yelp and the assistance of a small list and a single 6 sided cube with dots on it.

Everyone who works here is super friendly, and they know us now and know what we like to order by heart. We just walk in now and they see us and say ""Spicy noodle, tofu, hot, right?"" Its pretty great having a place that knows my regular order. I have tried most of the menu items. The garlic eggplant is also pretty great. The thai basil is also amazing. I have generally liked everything I have had here except the curry. I never have had a good curry experience. Both of the times I ordered it I ended up with long black hairs in it (which they quickly replaced with a new order) but I just wasn't a fan. Maybe it's because of the coconut milk and it makes it too sweet. The spring rolls are also the best here out of every spring roll I have had anywhere. Before I went vegan again last year we also got the fried banana ice cream pretty often. That is pretty amazing. If you eat dairy, you have to try it at least once. Thai Basil is one of our regular spots to eat out, and we hope its here to stay for many more years to come.

Although its not the only reason for our visit, a stop at Roberto's is a must when we're in the Phoenix area.  I have tried, and thoroughly enjoyed the al pastor tacos, beef chimichanga burrito, and I really like the way they crisp up the carnitas.My wife judges a Mexican restaurant by the quality of its chile relleno and says this is the chile relleno she has been waiting for: two to a plate, great presentation and delicious.  The light breading allows the flavors of the chili and cheese to dominate the palate as they should.She also recommends the tortas she had at breakfast. The bread, light and toasted perfectly, hugs a generous helping of carne asada (with fajita style onions and peppers), and if you like, guacamole.  Pair that with a cup of their terrific coffee, or if you have never had Jamaica, a delicious Mexican beverage brewed fresh from flowers, try it.  Either way you have a breakfast you won't forget.Oh, and by the way, the members of the local fire department showed up to order breakfast while we were there.  If they are eating there, you know it's good.  Just had to thank them for their service.  This is truly a restaurant where family meets family, Roberto's and yours.And for you insiders, we both love Roberto's homemade tamales.  Although they're not on the menu, we have been fortunate enough to take some of their tamales home during both of our visits.I believe tamales are normally made for the sale in the store on Thursdays (check with them to be sure), but they don't last.   On our first trip in 2008 to their old location, we stopped in for lunch (excellent) and were told that they were bringing in homemade tamales that afternoon.  We returned that night for dinner and to pick up some tamales that they kept for us.During our most recent trip we stopped in for breakfast on a Saturday.  But, fortunately for us, they were making tamales for a catering job the same day and sold us some of their extras.  We again returned in the evening for dinner and to pick up some tamales.These tamales are just like I wish my (Chinese) grandmother used to make.  Check with them to see when they're available.

Local Breeze was totally down to contribute. So on top of getting that delicious meal, know that your money is largely going back to the community. Awesome.But the food (and drinks) are really what keep me coming back. The coca-cola ham is delish, and the serving sizes are pretty decent. You definitely get your money's worth. And there's a reason why my profile says that my ""recent discovery"" is ""spiced cottage cheese from Local Breeze."" That was written months ago, but I don't think I've discovered anything quite as amazing yet. And I normally don't even like cottage cheese.The last time I went was for my bday dinner, and again, it didn't let me down. We had good food, good drinks, and a good time in general. The bartender mixed up this killer cucumber martini, which sounds weird, but if you're a martini fan, go for it.

I had no idea what type of food they had or what to expect.It was Sunday morning just around 9:30 and I was fortunate to be able to walk in and instantly have a table. The server was very friendly and she checked back often always refilling my coffee. The menu is a little newspaper and it's a bit overwhelming with many options, but I finally settled on the volcano. It is described as three pancakes, 2 sausage links, 2 bacon strips, and an egg. The pancakes are three different sizes and stacked to create a volcano with the egg on top. It was under $9 and I was surprised at the size of it! I attempted but could not finish it. The big pancake was left uneaten. They do have a smaller option for around $6 and that might be the better way to go unless you have just returned from a month long trip through the jungle or plan to share with someone. The server continued to check on me and even offered up a to go cup of coffee.

The vegetarian plate was massive and everything on the plate was delicious. Next time we'll pay the extra $5 and split one Vegetarian Plate instead of getting two. The pita and hummus were fresh and delicious, however, I find EG's hummus to be a a little thick for my preference and they use a heavy dose of tahini in their hummus.

The layout is a little strange, it looks like you should order at the big window with the kitchen behind it, but you actually order in the back right corner of the restaurant.  The girl who took my order was very friendly and made my fat ass feel welcome there, which is pretty rare these days.  She suggested I do the slider plate, which I did with a side of green chili mac and cheese and cornbread.  It took about 10 minutes for my order to come out, which is probably a good sign that they were at least spending some time cooking something back there.  The sliders were awesome, all the meat was very moist and full of smoky flavor, my favorite out of the three was definitely the pulled pork.  The green chili mac and cheese was also very good, which was somewhat surprising to me.  I was expecting Stouffer's with pickled jalapenos stirred in, but it was far from that.  For being the end of the night, it was very fresh and cheesy.  The only part of the meal that wasn't great was the cornbread, but I don't think you can really do much to cornbread to make it wow you anyway.  I definitely like this better than Honey Bears, and it doesn't even compare to the BBQ joke Famous Dave's.  When I have tailgate this year, Andrew's will definitely be my go to place for everything.

The coating is perfect and light so you can really taste the vegetables but still get the crunch. The same is true with the mozzarella. The cheese was fresh and the crunchy crust of fried coating around it was perfect. As far as entrees go, the portions are perfectly sized and flavorful.

Aside from the practical, in the land of Fox Restaurants (True aside) and the big box store at the strip mall, there really appears to be little demand for a small, local restaurant on a farm.

First, the house cured meats, including the head cheese, were amazing. Second, how often do you get a chef's menu where each person's plate is different? Not often. Ultimately we each tried 10 different items. And each item, was amazing.

For example, we each had an espresso sized cup of a creamy soup that was so delicate and delicious that we were wishing for more.  They also served us a little savory doughnut, about the size of a dollar coin, that was oh-so-good as well as little cranberry ""shooters"" that had little teenie squares of jello (not really jello, of course, but a fruit gel of some sort).  Somewhere in between everything else we were also served a prosciutto mousse that was smooth and delicate.  As the meal drew to an end, they again brought out a little taster and this time it was piping hot mini cinnamon souffles with a creme anglaise on top.  For dessert, I ordered the goat's milk panna cotta that had a marmalade bottom and alongside were orange, grapefruit and strawberry segments and to top that off the server drizzled honey over all.  Fantastic!We didn't consume any alcohol but we did have a nice bottle of water and purchased two coasters ($10/each) that flash colored lights when a glass is placed on them.

The sauces seem to not match or compliment the specific meat in my opinion. I would love a bordelaise sauce or onions and mushrooms with the filet for example.Appetizers: ?/?

The Stetson chopped was amazing.  The preparation is beautiful when they bring it out, and then the taste is the perfect mix of sweet, savory, crunchy, soft once the salad is mixed up.  I tried some of the testosterone salad, which was decent, and filled with a lot of well prepared beef, but it didn't quite compare to the chopped salad.  Just as a general side note, if you choose the restaurant week menu and have the chopped salad and then the mushrooms, I think the flavor of the chopped salad is more bold than the mushrooms, so the mushrooms will taste bland to you.  This happened to me as I transitioned from the salad to main dish, but when I took the mushrooms home in a to go box and ate them later, the more delicate flavor showed through and I appreciated it a lot more.  The bread pudding was amazing.

As my tummy growled today, I was in the neighborhood so I knew just where to go. I walked into a simple yet clean deli. Immediately, I was welcomed by the entire staff (I believe they are all related or at least family through friendship). They asked me if it was my first time in and I said yes, so right away they started giving me a history of the shop and the tasty cuisine. Celebrating their 33rd anniversary (congrats!!), I learned that everything is homemade -- from the meatballs to the chicken salad. The owner said he goes through 40 lbs of chicken a week. He gave me a sample and the chicken was chunky and delicious. I'm not surprised he has to prepare so much chicken every week! The meatballs and freshly cut meat for Philly Cheese-steak sandwiches looked great too! The owner mentioned he is from Philly so better be ready for some authentic Philly and Italian style cookin'! While I was there, the owner was slicing some fresh provolone, so I added that to the warmed turkey sandwich I ordered. The turkey was tasty, the provolone was yummy and the sourdough roll tasted like it was fresh from the oven. It was $8 for a sandwich and soda but the sandwich was hefty enough that I saved half for later. As I walked out, everyone said goodbye to me and I felt like I was leaving a family dinner. In summary, here's what made Casella's stand out: - The very friendly staff- It's a local family-owned neighborhood deli celebrating their 33rd anniversary. Gotta support the local businesses! - Clean decor - Tasty, homemade food that's on display for visitors to see - A good family-style atmosphere that greets you the second you walk inside. I'm not sure how it's taken my so long to find this local treat, but now that I've found it, I plan on becoming a regular. Directions: Note that this is hidden in the Basha's strip mall (on the side of Granite Reef) but don't let that fool you!",review,4ozupHULqGyO42s3zNUzOQ,3,5,2

However, I've been going for dinner to Flavors of India for nearly three years now, and have ALWAYS liked the food. FOI is my first choice for Indian cuisine in Phoenix, out of the four other Indian restaurants in the valley I've tried. Yes, FOI is in a strip mall, but once inside, the ambiance is pleasant. It seems quite clean, I never got sick from anything I ate there (that's saying a lot, as I admit to being a fussy eater), and the waitstaff is helpful. Bollywood videos on the large flat-screen wall display in the corner are an unusual feature, but the volume is low or completely muted, so you can watch or choose not to, it isn't distracting.   (Here's a footnote about that: I ate at FOI on the night of the presidential primary election. My dining companion noticed that most of the waitstaff was gathered around the TV in the bar, watching electoral results, so he asked our waiter if we could watch too. After getting the enthusiastic okay from the two other occupied tables, it was quite late in the evening, silent Bollywood was replaced by live news coverage with volume turned on).Regarding the food: I love their mattar paneer (cooked peas in a tasty curried gravy, with small cubes of homemade mild-tasting cheese).  My super-spicy friend gets the lamb vindaloo (super-spiced as he requests).  Tandoori shrimp, chicken and tikka masala are good though a bit pricier, the samosa appetizer (lightly battered and deep-fried cut vegetables) is fresh, warm and crunchy. Regular and garlic nan bread are everything they should be, biryani rice is overpriced (I'd stick with basmati rice as a side dish), and sweet lassi (a well-chilled dairy drink, similar in taste and consistency to a vanilla yogurt smoothy) is a nice treat. My spicy friend says his gin-and-tonic was weak, and they don't have ingredients to make a Bloody Mary, but hey, FOI is an Indian restaurant, so I can't fault them too much for that! Other pluses: open a bit later than many Phoenix restaurants (seating ends at 9:30 pm); very fast with takeout orders; there's lots of parking; the 16 North bus stop is nearby; silverware, glasses, white cotton tablecloths and napkins are always spotlessly clean.",review,8VikyrWXFKL8GU1a9t-o6Q,1,1,0

Yet the first time we ate at this Grimaldi's, we were blown away!  Upon entering, you are enveloped by the aroma of pizza baking in a coal-fired oven.  This is swoon-inducing---and I mean that in a good way.  The smell almost has you believing that you are in a pizza joint with a coal-fired oven in the Northeast.When ordering pizza baked in a coal-fired oven, I like to get a plain cheese pizza.  IMO, this is the best way to fully taste the sauce, cheese and crust without anything else get in the way.  There's nothing like a thin crust pizza from a coal-fired oven with that char on the crust.  The crust has just the right balance of crispy and soft.  The sauce is well flavored with proper proportions of basil and oregano.  The amount of cheese is just right.  I love to savor each and every bite.There is more to this Grimaldi's than the one under the Brooklyn Bridge.  This one has other items in addition to the pizza.  We like their antipasto.  It has sliced mozzarella which is fresh and creamy, black and green olives (the black ones are pitted, the green ones have pits in them),  roasted red pepper slices which are bursting with flavor, and a good, flavorful salami.Everytime we're in AZ, it is so worth it to us to deal with the heavy traffic in Old Town Scottsdale to dine at Grimaldi's!",review,16GhsZiS_ybqfHO-7Av07g,1,3,0

At first, it didn't click but the entire volleyball team from a nearby high school decided to come so it was extremely busy.They have some really good specials, but what really caught my eye was the specialty burgers that are $6. Big misunderstanding, most $6 are single patty and have some special toppings. Zipps decided to do a double-stacked specialtly burger. Yes, two 1/3 lb patties on a bun with some special toppings. We got two burgers and split them half and half, green chile burger and sweet jalapeno. Both were extremely awesome. You can get salad, fries, onion rings or half-half (half fries half onion rings). The fries kind of taste like In-n-Out fries, and my significant other would describe them as being better. I don't agree, and I don't disagree. Overall, good food, I can't wait to come back and try something else from their special menu. The $6 specialty burgers are available Tuesdays from 8-close and weekends from 11-4.The service was really awesome. They definitely cared about us and went out of their way to make sure we were doing okay. I think they felt guilty that we were there when a huge group was there as well. Apparently, they also were understaffed, but it honestly did not feel like it. Seriously though, it was some of the best service I've ever had at a Phoenix restaurant. To top it all off, the manager had checked up on us a few times, and at the end after we paid the bill he brought us a cookie platter (pizzookie, or cookie with ice cream).Now, I'm not a fan of pizzookie, but wow, their cookie platter was awesome. It wasn't on special that night, but I know its on special some other night and at $4 its probably worth a go again. Might I say one more thing about the cookie platter? It's just as good if not better than BJ's.I am actually excited to go here again. With some really good food specials almost any night, I think if I ever run out of ideas this might be the first place I think of. The food is a little greasy, but I think that is expected when you go to a sports grill. Want to lose 50 lbs, go to subway.

VVeogjZya58oiTxK7qUjAQ,4/21/10,8zw-XQNUZMRWMSDXA1nMXg,5,"Pizzeria Bianco: Before and After Cited as ""the best pizza in America"" in numerous on-line reviews as well as on Good Morning America and as published in, Slice of Heaven, to most pizza lovers the three to four hour wait for a table is so daunting that they push on to a more open table atmosphere for their pizza experience. But to the true pizza enthusiast, Pizzeria Bianco is as much about the experience as it is the food. This place is best known for the owner Chris Bianco, hand tossing each and every pizza pie served every Tuesday through Saturday, from 5-10 pm for nearly 15 years, of which I was one of those fortunate customers. However, early 2010 Chris was forced to retire due to illness and turn over the pizza paddle and oven duties to his prot̩g̩ of 15 years, Horatio Hernandez. My decision to try Pizzeria Bianco for the first time came from a challenge I put upon myself: Find the best food in metropolitan Phoenix. After hearing about Pizzeria Bianco from a friend, I made gourmet pizza my first battle in 2009. I knew about the long lines forming an hour or more before the restaurant opened, and this beautiful fall day was no exception. I arrived 60 minutes before opening and my date went to Bar Bianco to start us off with a couple of pale ale microbrews while I held our place in line. Seeing that there were only about 20 people ahead of us, we assumed we would make the 5:00 seating with no trouble. However, just as we were holding a place for the rest of our party, so were the 20 or so people ahead of us, and when the door opened promptly at 5:00, there were now over 50 people ahead of us. Needless to say we were left waiting another hour since the restaurant seats only about 40 at a time. When we were seated at 6:00, the four of us started with the homemade mozzarella, local tomato and sweet basil starter with extra virgin olive oil drizzled all over as well as homemade crusty bread with a dish of EVOO with a touch of balsamic added. We ordered three pizzas, the Sonny Boy providing salami, marinara sauce and gaeta olives, the Wiseguy a sausage and mozzarella taste explosion and the Marinara with Prosciutto di Parma. All three pizzas were piping hot when they arrived, just crisp enough around the edges and loaded with the most amazing flavors your mouth has ever experienced. We left the restaurant without remembering the nearly 3 hour wait and were fully satisfied, eager for the next opportunity to drive to 623 Adams in Phoenix for another ""slice of heaven"". And so, after hearing of the departure of Chris from the kitchen, curiosity got the best of me. I had to challenge this place and find out if the changing of the guard made any difference in the wait time, the food quality or the overall experience I had truly fallen for. April 6, 2010 again I ventured down to 623 Adams in Phoenix to see if a Tuesday night or a new head chef had made any difference at all. My date and I arrived at approximately 4:00 pm, one hour before the doors would open. We found a line of about 25 people and looked at each other and said, almost in unison, ""Well, the wait hasn't changed"". Bob trotted off to Bar Bianco to find our pale ale, Four Peaks to help pass the time. We caught a glimpse of owner Chris Bianco and I told Bob how I would love to chat with him seeing as I was writing a comparison review, I also wanted to find out who was cooking tonight. Bob stalked Chris into Bar Bianco and asked him if he had any time, would he be willing to take a picture with me and answer a couple of questions. When Bob returned with another beer and Chris Bianco in tow, I was star struck and could barely speak. All I could muster up was, ""Are you cooking tonight?"" To which he replied, ""No, I have Horatio at the oven. I can't cook anymore."" I explained my evaluative writing topic and he assured me the experience would be the same. We took a picture and off he went, back to the bar. At 6:15pm, after 2.25 hours of complete social enjoyment we were called to our seats at the bar. We ordered the same items we had enjoyed last fall with the exception of the Marinara. The overall experience was better for me as I got to enjoy personal time with Chris. As for the meal, it was just as amazing as I remembered it from 6 months prior with Chris tossing the pie for every customer. The flavors were exactly as I remembered and the service from the staff was top notch, just like the first time. From the wait to the taste, it didn't appear that anything had changed! So what makes for the ""best pizza in America"" and how did Pizzeria Bianco get the tag line? Well, my opinion is flavorful ingredients, a phenomenal social experience, and an owner who lives by what he serves. To Chris Bianco and the Pizzeria Bianco staff, you haven't skipped a beat!",review,Y0aovX_kbraKpdLYCzVHKA,4,5,2

The place is huge, sporting a bakery (said many times before) with unbelievably dirt cheap pastries (not said as many times before), a little carniceria (not as good as Carniceria Sonora) and a huge dining area.  The dining area with all its painted mural glory is so goddamn cool that I find myself wanting to just hang out there for hours watching La Primera Division de Mexico on TV and enjoying a nice $2 Dos Equis.  The food - that's probably the only tougher part.  Keep in mind it's still pretty good, but there are better places in the area for getting your Mexican on food wise.  The potato taco is worth getting because it's fairly unique, but it came out so soggy that I had to eat it with a fork.  I grabbed a couple of the Yelp-Advertised taquitos as well - keep in mind these are not the Circle K, rolling taquitos.  They are literally just smaller tacos, but they were damn good.I guess when it comes down to it, I'm an atmosphere buff.  There were so many cool things to check out in this multi-plex, and the atmosphere was so warm that I'd love to head back again soon.",review,mQba83gB018LlGt51r80ZQ,0,0,0

The servers are all very attentive and kind which makes the eating experience so much more enjoyable. So anyway, on to the sushi! I adore sushi rolls with some kind of crunch in them which is why I love anything tempura. The Big Shrimp Tempura Roll is my favorite and it could stand alone as a meal because it's so ginormous. They stuff 3 large tempura shrimp in there with avocado and cucumber then drizzle it with eel sauce. LOVE! And while I'm on the subject, Mikado has mastered the art of frying up a perfect tempura. Their tempura shrimp is super crispy, isn't greasy and always fresh out of the fryer. The Crunch Roll is superb, the salad dressing is addictive and the chicken noodle udon soup is delicious. Their prices are great and you still get so much food. How can you go wrong?

Now let me point out two issues: I'm not a huge fan of Mexican food, and I only get the Tacos Del Mar or Ono Fajitas which are versions of the same thing. The chips are fresh made and great as are the salsa and hot salsa (more peppery and hot). For appetizers the Chili Con Queso Dip and Nachos are good sized and tasty. For a friend and I this location is somewhat out of the way but we still go regularly. Try it.Detail:Like I said I'm not exactly a fan of Mexican food. I like the Americanized fast-ish food chains: Qdoba, Chipotle even Baja Fresh. I've eaten at actual Mexican restaurants in Mexico and had home cooked Mexican fish tacos and tamales.

So I pretty much got dragged there about two years ago and I liked it right away. Like I said, I've only really eaten the fish tacos but they're the best I've had. The fish is good, the sides are good, idk what chipotle cream is but it's good, good service, the chip lady is nice, all the wait staff have been good.It's typically not crowded but sometimes your go there and the place is close to full. I've never waited to be seated though. I've never tried the bar area. The water seams better than tap water...a dumb observation but I usually drink water rather than soda so I mention that. They give you a pitcher of water on seating and refill if needed. The chips and salsa are endless and excellent. Service is always good.Two friends typically get the Pollo Con Queso and swear it's the best ever.

BINYfrtGp3A4w0d5E7kbYw,2/17/11,ZpHwEE5ohvRJhE9-BwMS7Q,5,"I want to preface this review by saying that I'm close friends with one of the sushi chef's in training, so we got a seat right at the sushi bar and really had a great opportunity to chat.  That being said, I will review this strictly on the quality of food, since we received some deep discounts due to being VIP guests.  (C'mon now, you know you all get discounts too when you personally know the staff/chefs, so quit your whinin'!)The quality of the fish was excellent... some of the best sushi I've had in my existence.  The key to getting good sushi is to trust in the chef, and ask them what is fresh, and what they would suggest (omakase style).  We had a sashimi appetizer platter to start which featured blue fin, yellow tail, o-toro (yes, the good stuff!), and a few other pieces.  Served with fresh wasabi root (not the hydrated green powdery stuff), this appetizer really woke our stomachs and senses.We had a few different rolls per the chef's suggestion, and all were spectacular (including some off the menu rolls).  The kim bap roll was highly recommended, and the quality was definitely memorable, better than most Korean-mom kim bop rolls I've had in my life.We asked for ama-ebi (sweet shrimp), which was soft, tender, and sweet, with perfectly fried shrimp head to back.  This was the first time I've had such perfectly made ama-ebi, and it's made me want to continue my search in Chicago.Some tasty mochi desserts, a few bottle of sake, and all in all, it was a very enjoyable night for my compadres and I.  I'm sorry for those that have found a bad experience at Otaku, as it sounds like most of it is waitstaff issues... but as a sushi fanatic, my advice to you is this:1.  Don't ask for a table if you're party is smaller than 4... ask for a spot at the sushi counter, because that's how sushi is meant to be served.  Getting to know your chef, the chef getting to know you, having drinks together, etc.  2.  Ask the chef what he/she recommends.  Not all fish are equally fresh, and the chef will know what's best for the day.  And if you can provide them with your own past experience of what you liked/didn't like, they'll likely craft a sushi experience for you that you'll love.Verdict:  If only Otaku were in Chicago... I might go broke.  Delicious sushi, and worth a visit!",review,obNXmSNJ-DjzJC3nzfVkDg,3,4,0

eTbtfgUtfewdncgVf2CbWw,9/16/12,UIUfEDc62fpMxWCW3Lc5PQ,5,"Owned and operated by Eugenia Theodosopoulos (an Ohio native, fyi) and considered by many to be the best patisserie/bakery in the state I approached Essence with a note of skepticism largely assuming much of the hype was derived from Tempe's plethoric college crowd but arriving at the doors of the small shop on a particularly lovely 80 degree morning I gathered quite quickly that my original conceptions were misplaced; not only does Essence not look like a college haunt, neither do its prices or products - a vast selection of at least twenty items aside from the posted menu sitting beneath and atop a glass case forcing me to make more than one tough decision that was not helped by my server's accurate assessment that everything was really good.Now bearing in mind that the original impetus to visit Tempe on this particular morning was to visit Caffe Boa and that Essence was more of 'pre-meal' activity what follows may seem slightly gluttonous, but to be fair once I took my first bite of Theodosopoulos's cole Len̫tre trained almond croissant I knew I was in good hands and everything else just sort of followed.  Without a doubt my favorite breakfast pastry and perhaps my favorite French pastry overall, Essence's $3 twice baked option arrives slightly smaller than the average but with a shell that crackles to the tooth and an interior that is at once yawning pockets of air and nearly overloaded with butter and light frangipane there is no doubt that this is a case of ""big things in small packages,"" and particularly in its still-warm morning state the flavors and textures rivaled those at Dominique Ansel and Payard Las Vegas for best I've had stateside.Moving next from the baked goods to one prepared from the menu my second taste of the morning aside from the slightly earthy and lightly leather accented coffee was Essence's ""Signature"" French Toast, a $7.25 selection featuring three griddled slices of eggy brioche and a sidecar of what I can best describe as banana infused caramel.  Rich but thinly sliced and therefore nicely saturated each piece of the French Toast was exactly as it should be - the exterior crisp and the interior custard-while the sauce provided a pleasant balance of fruity notes and intrinsic sweetness that complimented rather than overwhelming the bread.At this point submitting to the fact that I was going to eat even the items I'd bought 'for later,' my next two tastes were a pair of $2.95 macarons that, much like the croissant, rivaled those both here and abroad in terms of taste and texture while opting for a much more rustic approach terms of size and presentation.  Beginning first with Pumpkin Spice and then proceeding to Vanilla with Dark Rum each palm-sized cookie was exactly what one would expect from a well trained pastry chef as the exterior shell provided a slight crackle on bite subsequently giving way to a soft meringue followed by dense cream that slowly dissipated on the tongue - the cinnamon and nutmeg notes of the former particularly notable while the rum in the second was appropriately understated thus serving to highlight the vanilla of the shell.If there were any 'misstep' on the morning, it *might* have been the ""Summer Berry Croissant Bread Pudding,"" though when I say misstep I must temper the comment with the fact that my quibble is only that I prefer the French/English take on the dish while this one was more based on the French Custard style, a rich vanilla bean pudding without a lot of crunch or textural variance but instead laden with blackberries, raspberries, and strawberries plus a sidecar of lightly sugared strawberries.  Focusing more of the natural sweetness of the fruits and aromatics of the vanilla than the typical overly sweet versions served stateside it was more panna cotta than bread pudding to me, but chalking that up to personal tastes it was still delicious.Moving last to the one dish that gave me trepidation, the ""French Napoleon"" gave caused pause not only because the name clearly skewed towards a subset unfamiliar with a proper Mille-Feuille but also because so many pre-made versions of this layered pastry have failed to wow in the past...thankfully this was not the case at Essence.  Featuring light and crunchy layers of choux easily withstanding the tines of a fork without turning into a smooshy mess (see ""Mille Feuille New York"") intertwined with rich pastry cream speckled with dots of vanilla bean and ripe raspberries what truly made this version stand out was the manner in which Theodosopoulos caramelized each layer of choux, a technique reminiscent of Pierre Herme and as good as the French icon's version was I'd be hard pressed to say Essence's was any less impressive.  It would be awesome to see what they could do a la minut like Savoy, L'Arpege, or Genin and given the names I've dropped in the paragraphs above plus Essence's proximity I've no doubt I'll be returning to see what else the small shop is capable of soon.",review,5lq4LkrviYgQ4LJNsBYHcA,2,3,3

No wait at 8:45 on a Friday night (yes! take that Pizzeria B) and the atmosphere of this house is super intimate and cool.  I love the atmosphere of the patio also, lit with those great off-white lights, and fire pits.  We shared the burrata which was gynormus, easily enough for 4 people or a hungry us.  The wine was tasty and reasonable.  I was drinking a pinot grigio, and my guy had the house chianti which I never usually order anywhere since it almost always reminds of grandmas table wine - until I tried Cibo's house version.  It was very good, definitely not from grandmas!   Now for the pizza - it is just perfection.  It has that amazing combination of char on the crust, crispy on the outside, chewy on the inside with the right balance of sauce and toppings.  It almost melts in your mouth, it's not heavy at all.  It's nice to go out for a pizza dinner with and app and dessert and not feel like you have to roll yourself out of the joint!  So we finished our romantic mystery date night with a crepe filled with nutella, ricotta, AND a scoop of ice cream on top.  I don't typically die over dessert, it's my boyfriends thing.  I'm an app girl - but this, it wasn't too sweet, it was so gooey and delicious and the ice cream added just the right amount of sweetness.  I would never eat here without dessert again!  I have been for lunch and they can get you in and out in a little less than an hour, but they don't fire up the pizza oven till supper which is why I prefer that here.  You will feel at home at this spot in a group or on a date - hell, maybe even a mystery one :)",review,qkbiaiS8t8YHWx3J04NjSw,0,0,0

I have tried gluten free pizzas almost everywhere you can find them, and they are always too dry, too thin, too soggy, or completely different flavor than what pizza crust should taste like. Picazzo's gluten free pizza is delicious, the crust is pretty thick and has a good texture, not like a big saltine cracker as most places tend to be. the flavor is true to pizza crust! my friends even like it so much they will split a gluten free pizza with me instead of ordering 'regular' crust.There is also a range of appetizers that are delicious, caprese salad with gluten free bread and the spinach dip are my faves. The employees are all very nice and aware of gluten intolerance--they check with you before they bring you additional food items or before putting GF and non-GF foods together in your to go box. I love it. If you are gluten or wheat intolerant and  you like pizza, this will be your new favorite place. Totally worth the drive, and the money. But the prices are very reasonable for GF food!",review,kNzDEbEdnbdFgnaYD8r6nw,0,1,0

We sat by them, because they seemed awesome and in great company, the food flourished in my eyes.  They have a pretty decent beer selection, they had my favorite Sonoran White Chocolate ale and my boyfriend had something he loved on tap called the Bell's Two Hearted Ale (but apparently it's an amazing IPA). I knew I'd love mine, he LOVED his.We had the Mac and Cheese, which was awesome, but not as amazing as others I've had.  So order it if your a Mac person, but don't if you're not.  We had two sandwiches for dinner, I had the Acapulco Cheesesteak (UNBELIEVABLE!!!!!!!!!!!)  and Seann had the RB&C (an equally impressive Roast Beef concoction). Those were both devoured with great beer and great conversation with others.Lastly we had the Triple Chocolate Brownie, per a recommendation from our fellow dog owner and it was delish.  VERY VERY chocolatey and too much food after an app, a sandwich and two beers, but it was definitely worth trying.Overall the food would have gotten a four, but the experience with cool people around us, and a great waitress really sealed the 5 star deal.  Now being added into the rotation.  Thank you Main Ingredient! : )",review,dj-vs4rukH6dXWVpPOq0_g,1,2,0

I have to say this is one of the best meals I've ever eaten, hands down. We bought a Restaurant.com gift certificate that cost $10.00 for a $50.00 Gift Certificate. They also have half priced bottles of wine on Friday nights as well.I went with the 5 course menu. I chose 2 of the dishes, and let the chef pick the other three. We started out with the Crudo Cheese plate that was phenomenal! It had goat cheese, goat feta, goat mozarella (sooo good), cherry compote, roasted dates, tomatoes, cured lamb jerky, smoked olives and truffles with toast. If that doesn't give you a food stiffy, your not human. The first dish I had, which was one I picked, was the butterfish crudo. It was served with oven roasted tomatoes and lardo with some sort of escebeche type sauce, hands down my favorite plate in Phoenix right now. Holey cow! Next, I had the albacore crudo with truffles, apples, black garlic and pepper. Another amazing dish. My next dish was one the chef selected as well, it was their Japanese Fish Market Special. I don't recall the type of fish, but it was good. I felt bad for this plate though, it had to follow some illlll dishes. The 4th course I had was the mushroom gratin. It had hen of the woods, crimini, potato and was topped with an egg. I felt it was just too much, a little clunky. That's probably just my taste though, there was nothing wrong with the execution of the dish. I finished with the roasted veal served with parmesan creamy polenta. Friggin amazing, I wanted to whisper sweet nothing into it's ear and smack it on the boohiney.  We went with a great bottle of Nebbiolo, that was exceptional. The service was excellent. At first I was kind of weirded out with the restaurant being inside a retail shop, but we moved to one of the high top tables and it felt more like a quaint little cafe.

Always avoided going because we tend to not like restaurant chains, but this place is a gem and exceeded our expectations.The bar area is relatively small, but very classy.  We were able to have few drinks at the bar ($5 for beer, wine, and their signature cocktails) before we were able to get a table in the bar area for 5 people...thanks to Leah and the hostess staff (you guys are great).  Didn't have a bad drink -- loved the The Original Hawaiian martini was delish, as was the mojito, jalapeno margarita, mai tai, and wine.  A friend was sad the cucumber drink she liked was missing from the menu, but sounds like the menu changes often so diners/drinkers get a chance to try new concoctions throughout the year.  For food, we tried most of the HH specials.  Everything was spot on -- excellent flavors and beautifully presented.  The tuna roll and tempura shrimp rolls were my favorites (sushi rolls), with the lobster pot-stickers being a close second.  Some friends ordered dinner...and were able to speak with Chef Bray about his recommendations for fish.  She ended up getting the Crab Dynamite Baked Barramundi, which was so yummy!  The happy rice on the side was great too.   My hubby got the Yellow Fin Ahi Poke -- something we have looked for since trying some fresh poke in Kona, HI last year.  I couldn't believe the flavors...eating poke in the AZ desert!  Its preparation with the Wasabi Cr̬me Frąche made it a meal we will seek out again in the near future.

WSHQ9qpL39g5xA3E5iBCmw,3/18/12,FrUT9VYLb7WvaVdCwT86ew,5,"As a frequent traveler into Scottsdale, I was looking for something new and different to celebrate with a young up and coming professional baseball player---who happens to be my nephew. We were forewarned this place had no prices on their online menu and appeared to be owned by Mastro's which consistently has excellent food. Michael Dominick opened Dominick's Lincoln Avenue Prime Steakhouse last fall after baseball season in the small, but excellent Scottsdale Quarter. (I'll admit to frequenting this Nike store in travels to Phoenix.) The ambiance is that of an elegant steakhouse. The rooms are dark with huge crystal chandeliers. Very opulent without being ostentatious!. We both ordered the bone-in filet which is an excellent aged prime cut. Supposedly, according to our very professional server, this cut is about 16 oz with a bone yielding about a 14 oz serving. My limit on steak is typical 6-8 ounces and I ate my entire meal, making me think (1) This place really is THAT GOOD, and (2) I doubt this is more than a 10 oz serving. We started with a warm assortment of breads and in deference to my guest, we minimized the veggie's ordered. (I'll go back during baseball season :-) ) After ordering a glass of of the extensive, but reasonably priced wine list, we looked at dinner entree. The steaks come with a choice of rubs and sauces. The house rub was described as ""cajun-style, but not overwhelming"". My theory is sauces on steaks are useful for poor cuts of meat, but take away from great cuts; hence, I went no sauce. The result was an incredibly great dinner of Bone-in filets ordered medium rare, no sauce and a loaded mashed potato side. (This side comes pre-prepared or you can ask for ramikans of cheese, chives, bacon and sour cream and build as you like at the table. We finished with a scoop of ice cream and a cappuccino for desert. Excellent steak spot and a welcome high-end addition to the Scottsdale food scene.One comment: The ""Branding"" of the restaurant is confusing.

I ordered the Jewish Slider like Adam did, but I didn't take the challenge. 1 order of Jewish SIiders are 3 sliders. The sliders were awesome. The meat was tender and really juicy. The cheese didn't really make a difference, it just added a little flavor, but the bun soft and chewy, and buttery which tasted like pancakes without syrup, and it was fresh. The potato pancakes put the lid on the jar. The potato pancakes aren't just a creative idea, it was very crunchy on the outside and soft on the inside. There are 3 reasons why this isn't a normal slider. Reason number one is the Potato Pancakes, reason number two is the meat isn't a patty, and grinded beef that made that slider interesting.

Huge bonus.I had a half chicken shawarma and  half gyros plate which came with hummous, salad, rice, cucumber (substituted instead of pita since I don't eat wheat... nice touch) and a side of garlic sauce.  I do not normally enjoy chicken shawarma, but he insisted I try.  Well, he was right, I will say now I love chicken shawarma, Aladdin's chicken shawarma.  Their gyros was awesome too.. homemade, not the typical Kronos Meat Cone variety.  I paid after my meal and was welcomed back with a handshake.

I am tired of people complaining about the prices at Sapporo.    When you compare price vs. quality you will always be in a favorable position.  If you cannot afford Sapporo perhaps you shouldn't eat there. I am not trying to sound arrogant, but you truly get what you pay for.   Sapporo consistently prepares the best  sushi I have had in Arizona.2.  I understand wait time may be an issue.  I suggest that you arrive early and anticipate a wait.  Honestly, is thirty minutes on a Friday night going to bother you?  The food is well worth the wait.  3.  Please stop wearing flip-flops and bathing suits.  Perhaps this is the reason you are experiencing ""rude"" service.  A pair of jeans and a polo is fine.  Sapporo is a Phenomenal restaurant.

This one is closer to me, so this is the one I go to, but if you are looking to have a large group, you may wish to go to the Mesa location.   That said, I really like this one.

Seriously, look at that menu, look at those pictures. The first time I was there I had the chicken tikka masala pasty. Not as good chicken tikka as a straight up Indian restaurant, of course, but still phenomenal, and the pasty just made it that much better. I also snagged the bananoffee pie.

We never really talked with the waitresses or knew their names, but they always knew what I wanted; I didn't have to order.  They always gave me water with no ice no lemon, my husband's with ice and lemon, gave me my panang curry with chicken medium and waited for my husband to choose what he wanted. He probably ordered most of the items on the menu.  They refilled my rice if I ran out without asking.  Our bill always came to $19.53 for dinner more times than I can remember.

I was too full from all the sampling with the different vendors. My coworkers and I went to check out the food trucks that gather on Thursday outside of Whole Foods by Raintree and the 101. I saw that Mojo Bowl was there and made my mind up right away to get their food.I decided to get the Red, White, and Kale salad. I love quinoa and kale so it was the obvious choice for me. I also wanted to try one of their smoothies out. I went with the Coco Coca. The description mentioned that it was like a drinkable Almond Joy and I was sold right there. The total came to $13, not too shabby considering the portions. I didn't even touch my salad because the smoothie was so fulling, definitely a meal in itself. Towards the end of the work day I was getting hungry and decided to try some of the salad. I was asked if I wanted a balsamic or raspberry vinaigrette to go with the salad. I told the guy whatever tastes better and he told me that would be the raspberry vinaigrette. The salad was delicious. The kale was chopped up so finely that it really didn't have a taste so if you're not a huge fan of kale you might still like the salad. The portion was huge, it was good for 2 meals. I try to eat healthy and like to support local businesses. Mojo Bowl definitely brings those two together for me.

Boy Howdy, am I glad I found this little gem!  Upon entering I was overwhelmed with the idea that we were in an Italian friend's grandma's circa 1980's dining room.  It was quaint.  It was old school.  It kinda made me a little nervous!The general feel of the waiter we had was extremely laid back.  Traditional Italian dude who was a little tardy in checking back, etc.  Our water glass was NEVER refilled.  Got a little more nervous.They brought out really good looking bread and poured some herbed olive oil out for me (I declined because I have celiac disease and can't have regular bread.).  My husband said the bread and the olive oil was amazing.  I had called ahead and they said they had many gluten free options.I ordered the Chicken al Berto.  My husband ordered veal and a side of spaghetti with meat sauce.  We started with a Tomato Caprese appetizer.  The tomato was slightly under ripe but the mozza and basil made up for it...and in the center was a bunch of roasted red peppers which totally made the dish!  Nom nom nom.  The balsamic was excellent as well.  I must now do peppers with my Caprese!Then our entrees came out.  My chicken had fontina cheese, pancetta and spinach.  There was a little line of mushrooms in a marsala sauce which I'm not sure if it was supposed to be there or not.  I'm super happy it was!  This is close to if not the BEST chicken dish I've eaten.  The chicken was moist which is usually questionable in Italian restaurants I've found.  The quality of the Fontina cheese was impeccable.  The pancetta was crisp and plentiful.  Then I tasted the mushrooms!!!! OMG!!  Freaking amazing!  I may have to try the Chicken Marsala sometime just to have more mushrooms!  Divine.  It took a while to eat, mainly due to the waiter's ""chill"" attitude but we shall go back again and again and again.  I don't care if you don't get anything included with your main entree.  The portion of entrees were HUGE.  My husband loved both his veal dish and said the meat sauce was one of the best he's had.  Fresh, fresh, fresh.It's on my new list of first priority restaurants.  And I think the prices were pretty good.  Less than $15 for my chicken, $20 for the veal and $10 for the Caprese.

I found the prices easily justifiable in fact I though them quite reasonable.  We had the three onion tart appetizer, which was spectacular. For entrees we had salmon, filet, and a pair of lamb shanks.  Everything was wonderful.  The presentation was clean and the freshness and quality of the proteins, produce and accoutrement's was immediately evident.  Everything was cooked skillfully.  Had three of the four desserts on the menu.  The chocolate raspberry tart definitely stood out followed closely by the berry tart.

The only way I found out about this place was through Yelp.  You seriously are my trusty sidekick.  From the previous reviews I was a little worried that it might be packed, but then I remembered it was a Monday night so no worries.Walking in the restaurant, it is quite small, but just absolutely adorable.  It really does feel like an upscale country home.  Wood lines the whole restaurant and they have mini chandeliers hanging over every table.  Even the touches of place setting are just perfect.Our server was Gina and she was a complete sweetheart.  We started off with the Bohemian Sidecar and the Cucumber Vesper.  Both were absolutely delightful!  Then we moved on to appetizers, because while getting drunk is fun, I was really excited for the food.  We had the steak tartare and mussels in the saffron and white wine sauce.  I loved the steak tartare with the potato chips and fried egg on top.  Put fried egg on top of anything and I'm sold.  Put fried egg on top of raw steak and I'm in love!  The mussels came out just as we were finishing up the steak tartare, perfect timing!  The mussels were equally amazing if not more, and I am so sad that they only give one piece of bread!  Well that, along with the bread and butter.  But that still wasn't enough for me!  I wanted to soak up all of that saffron sauce goodness!After Gina cleared that out of our way, she brought out the glass of Bordeaux and Rhone blend.  I hate when I don't have a drink in front of me, and she made sure that never happened.  Then the entrees came.  The pork shoulder with the bacon for my bf, and the stuffed chicken with the pome puree and mushrooms for me.  Again, absolute perfection on both accounts!  I loved the mushrooms that were slightly charred and crispy, with the sauce and the puree and the chicken with goat cheese.  I'm getting hungry again just writing about it.  My bf loved his, but I still maintain that mine was better.  And both of these entrees were incredibly reasonably priced at $15 and $17.  Could life get any better?Well apparently it could!  After we polished off our entrees, then came dessert and after dinner drinks!  We had the souffle which was amazing with the creme anglaise.  And the berries with the creme fraiche.  Heaven in my mouth!  We finished that off with the chocolate martini and the pear tini.This review cannot do this place justice.

The food is predominantly Filipino; the Filipino-Mexican fusion comes in the burritos, flautas and quesadillas filled with Filipino meat dishes. A great starter would be the Chicken Adobo burrito. Karey's does it right by not dumping rice and fillings inside the burrito; they're served on the side. For those more interested in rice plates and combinations, Karey's serves daily prepared dishes such as Pork Adobo and Chicken Adobo (pork or chicken simmered in garlic and soy vinaigrette) and Beef Mechado (a type of stew with beef chunks, potatoes, and onions in a light tomato gravy) with either white rice or Garlic Fried Rice (yummy). There are also specials that rotate each day, which can be checked out on their Twitter account. This is a great idea as one can find out when they are serving Lechon (roasted pig)! Yum!There are dishes that can be prepared fresh but are not part of the combination specials.  The ones I've tried that I highly recommend are their Lumpia (fried eggrolls in chicken, beef, or vegetable) and Pancit Canton (stir-fried noodles with vegetables).

You know the kind; the Phoenix area is plagued with them. Hana is BYOB, and there are only a few ridiculous fusion rolls on their sushi menu: most of it is authentic, real sushi. On my first visit I started with my usual appetizers, and was immediately struck by how unusually fresh and tasty they were. The seaweed salad had just the right amount of sesame oil, giving it incredible flavor. The veggie gyoza were indescribably delicious. They made me realize I'd never had a fresh gyoza before; every one I'd eaten previously in my life was a pale imitation of these little bits of Heaven.The sushi came out fast, even though it was fairly busy this particular Thursday. The first thing I noticed, naturally, was that someone put a burning sugar cube on the tray. ""Hey, fire!"" I thought. It was a nice touch.Then I saw, nestled between the flaming sugar and the wad of wasabe, a small pile of what looked like pickle relish. I guessed what it was, and our waitress confirmed it: it was FRESH wasabe.Real, fresh-grated wasabe is something most people never experience. Most people don't even know the pasty green stuff that's standard in every sushi restaurant is just normal horseradish dyed green. The real stuff is just too expensive, and too difficult to keep on hand. But there it was, no extra charge. It adds a little spice and a wonderful, fruity complexity to the sushi. The sushi was great.

IpqgfODLFPww-6TxCk-LJQ,4/13/08,bRhF_oqWpycPjb5acrIKIw,5,"Owner Daniel M. is one of my most favorite restaurateurs in Phoenix. His stamina and passion for the business of serving fine cuisine is a rare find. Daniel is from South America but you wouldn't know it; his knowledge of the secret kitchens of Tuscany, Umbria and Amalfi is uncanny. I know this because I traveled with him and his chef one year on their odyssey through Italy.Daniel takes special pride in personally choosing a very select few bottles of wine to fit any budget. OK, it's not Etienne's Different Point of View's list of 4000, but know that any choice you make is going to be a good one. If you're not sure, just ask for Daniel and tell him what you have in mind -- likely he has (with a wink) a special bottle in the back.When we traveled through the Italian countryside I was constantly astonished by the warm greetings and special invitations we had from local proprietors who shared with us exquisite homemade wines and dishes made with pride from the finest vegetables and livestock. We frequently stayed long past closing with the owners and into the night sampling rare port and grappa. At one restaurant in Orvieto the owner took us deep into the dank recesses of the wine cellar for a special sampling  of cheese and wine. Talk about knowing people? One afternoon while drinking our 5th bottle of wine, who walks by but Jan D'Atri! Wow. (That's another review.) And speaking of reviewers, I also ran into Phoenix Magazine's Nikki Buchanan (also extremely nice).When Daniel first opened in this location with that little stone oven in the corner, it was a pizzeria and guests could belly up to long tables in a casual environment that was made easy by his banter with the heavy Italian accented waitress (name?) who made a comeback some years later. For quite some time the restaurant was Il Forno; that is until corporate giant Il Fornaio entered the fray and sued him to change the name. After much rigmarole he changed to aqua e sale -- and notice Il Fornaio has since closed its doors? LOL. Again after much hoopla, he made it Daniel's. The current wood-paneled decor makes me think of a city club in San Fran or London. Very posh, yet understated. Selections of sculpture and art from his travels dot the restaurant's three small dining rooms.The menu is a very difficult one. I say that because it has all of your favorites and it is difficult to make your final selection. Great for steak, ravioli, the best carpaccio in the city, best buffala mozzarella, mmm.... I could go on and on. So does the menu, page after page.Some might call the preparations simplistic. This is the Tuscan way. Simple ingredients and simple preparation. Let the ingredients make their own magic. Grilled rack of lamb is not drowned in some Smucker's lime jelly, but gently brushed with rosemary and garlic, tickled with salt and pepper and finished with a squeeze spray of lemon.Unfortunately the artful one-of-a-kind plates and bowls handmade in Vietri chipped at the edges over the years and the health department made him throw them away -- UGH!! -- they were a beautiful motivation to make you lick your plate clean to see the painted pictures beneath your scrumptious dinner. Not that you needed an excuse to dab every last bit of sauce with the wonderful mini loaves of bread cooked right there in the hearth that started it all.Daniel himself is a wonderful host. He loves to give his guests a wonderful experience. There are many choices for Italian food in Phoenix. Most of it is just American Italian. Daniel's is a unique touch of the simple yet elegant. Enjoy.P.S. [post edit] OMG. How could I forget the Tiramisu? It's a generous portion, so you can share with your guest, but after your first bite you may not want to. Light and airy, yet fantastically flavorful, the quality of the coffee really makes this dish a reason to go back again and again. I'm not going to tell you the secret ingredient. You'll have to ask Daniel.",review,hDlSSyDreM9xY4yQWPm54w,2,3,1

It's probably not, but it tastes like it.  And secondly, their little salsa bar is killer because their green salsa has plenty of flavor and they always have fresh pico de gallo out there, a must for any burrito.The California Burrito, with carne asada, potatoes, pico de gallo and cheese, is a must, as is the standard Carne Asada Burrito.

But Man they know how to cook. I had a Special Shrimp dish of the night that was much better than expected and a very nice portion. The Calamari was 1000 times better than any other I have had. I am not a big fan usually, but this was different. It was not fried but pan cooked and even people that didn't like Seafood tried it and loved it. The Wedge Salad was good. We shared the Mac & Cheese, Mashed Potatoes and Peas. I felt the sides were the only things that could stand some improvement. I had one of the tasty Mojitos and some Yummy Creme Brulee for desert. I am super glad this place is far away because I would want to go all the time. It is a bit pricy, but I felt it was worth it. The servers were really cool. Not uptight at all. The only thing I hated was they have rest room attendants. Maybe it is just me, but come on.

It's been about two years since my last visit and in the past couple of months I've already been here like three times and wanted to go back more. I've decided that it's all about what you order; for example the first time I went I probably felt overwhelmed with all the choices and decided to go for something really plain like turkey with hardly any toppings, have fun! Their menu has a wide variety of yummy sandwiches and lots of new tastes to try. Also, don't be afraid to speak up. I was a little disappointed by the lack of lettuce and veggies on one of my veggie sandwiches but I also didn't pay attention. Now I ask for lots of lettuce and they're happy to make it the way I like. They make their breads fresh and they have garlic-herb bread that has lots of flavor. I won't order a sandwich from there without a side of ranch dressing. I am a picky ranch eater...I hate mayonnaise so I am always super careful that ranch doesn't taste or resemble mayo. I usually like restaurant mayo that is a little more runny in consistency with lots of flavor. They have the best home made ranch dressing here! Pair it with the garlic-herb bread and your sandwich is going to be booming in flavor. OMG! Wipe...sorry I just started to drool a bit. Service is good...everyone runs at the same chill pace which seems to go well with the theme of this restaurant. My current favorite is the Humboldt sandwich...I get the Pinner (8"") but I swear some days I am so hungry I think I'm going to order the Blunt (12"")...maybe someday soon. All sandwiches get toasted. Okay so toppings: Guacamole, sprouts, lettuce/spring mix, onions, mushrooms, tomatoes, black olives (I get mine w/o), cucumbers, pickles, your choice of cheese (I get Swiss), with their house goodies (EVOO, vinegar, herb mixture on top). Now that I found my sandwich, I crave it all the time and can't wait for my next visit. Oh, be sure to check their daily specials too!

My bf and I visited the brewery after a long day at the Phoenix Zoo. The location was easy to find with plenty of street parking (although it could be difficult during peak hours). We found a nice table on the half-indoor seating area. The ambiance was very cool, with a converted loft warehouse sort of feel.The bf had the beer sampler, which I helped myself to some sips of. I ordered a pint of the Kilt Lifter, which was a great deal during happy hour. Next, I tried the Pumpkin Porter (full price, even during happy hour). Foodwise, I had the pub fish and chips, which are battered in Kilt Lifter, and the bf had the french dip. Both items were on par with good quality pub fare.Kilt Lifter: great medium brew, very smooth. The type of beer you could drink every day and never tire of. Pumpkin Porter: we loved it so much, we purchased a growler so we could take some home! Note: there is an extra charge for filling up a growler with a seasonal brew. $4 for the growler itself, $10 for beer, and $5 seasonal charge. Normal refills of growlers are $10.I am a beer lover. I have spent time living in Munich and drinking some of the best beers in the world. You can't go wrong with Four Peaks brews.

After pre-yelp, we knew what to expect as to prices, so it wasn't so much of a shocker.To the food, we concur with almost everyone here. It was impeccable! We ordered the ice tower for 2 and thought that it was very well presented. Ours came with 3 appetizers (raw oysters, crab claws and dungeness crab) so it wasn't too high. They are all fresh. Growing up I used to go to the beach quite often just to have fresh crabs, so I know what those taste like. And for 6 years living in the desert, Mastro's is the first and only one in AZ to deliver that.  For main course, I got Ivory Salmon ""Oreganata"", bf got Swordfish blackened. I am quite picky when it comes to fish, and bf isn't exactly a fish person, but both of our dishes ""surpassed expectation."" I couldn't say much about swordfish except it was fresh. We had the same dish 2 weeks before at somewhere else, it was nowhere near as sweet and fresh as the one at Mastro's. It was my first having Ivory Salmon, it was sweeter, and white (hence the name) than normal salmon we get around here. Mine was good size portion, firm to the touch, but melted in the mouth. The flavor was subtle enough to enjoy by itself, or you can add one of the sauces provided. One of my favorite sauces of the night I think was made of minced tomatoes and olives, came with the main course.Sides were Lobster Mash and Snap peas. I didn't really care for snap peas as I can make them at home. But lobster mash is a MUST for those who go there. I'm not sure how they prepared it, but it felt like mash potatoes made with lobster bisque (instead of water and milk) and added lobster chunks. It was much more flavorful and creamy than a normal mash potatoes. It was big enough to share and take home. One thing though, it hardened up after sitting out for awhile, so I'm not sure if microwave could make it all fluffy again after 1 night in the fridge.Drinks there are amazing, from the presentation, to the taste, and definitely the amount of alcohol in each drink. We decided to go with cocktail drinks rather than wines because of other yelpers' reviews. Total worth it!!!The service was amazing. We had Robert. We pretty much asked him for recommendations for everything, yet he was nice about it and very knowledgeable. Next time we go back, I would definitely ask for him again.We didn't order dessert since they gave us a dark-chocolate ""Happy Anniversary"" cake with the letters written, also, in chocolate. The overall experience was 4 3/4, just because it was a bit difficult talking to each other. The acoustic of the room wasn't very good and it got loud. Didn't see much of cougar/manther scene as we were in the dining room. And maybe it was during weekdays, we saw lots of ""expense account"" people though",review,WCBz-xTApNh4u1VA_HKNLQ,0,2,0

They have this guy (Guido) come every Tuesday and he starts making hand made pasta early in the morning. He picks 2 unique dishes. It was one of the best pasta I have EVER tasted.

7U8TYNW4Mvx6m3zexsO0sg,5/24/09,6k10WTLws4YhK9h3evIJkQ,5,"""Fine dining"" is not just a setting.  it isn't just good food.  It is many things that add up to an attitude. I have had the opportunity to find it in different cities. I found it the other night at the Stockyards.We were seated by a host who took us to our table and when we were properly seated gave us menus.  Our server came to the table and introduced herself and said she would return shortly.  It was nice to have a moment to chat before we had to think about ordering.  When she did return,  our glasses were filled-not something we should have  to wait for her to do when the service is right.  She knew the selections on the menu and all available options and could make sensible comments concerning them.  Our salads were served promptly by two additional people and were as fresh as I could ask for.  When my friend was finished with hers they asked if they could take her plate.  I was pleased when they didn't ask me if I was finished with my salad and could they take my plate.  If I'd been finished I could have told them.  We were able to continue our conversation uninterrupted as I finished my salad.  The salad plate was removed  when it was appropriate and we had a few minutes before the entrees were served.  All was in keeping with a relaxed dining.  At no time did I have to think about having drinks refilled, it just happened quietly.After a few minutes our dinners were served by the two gentlemen and our server appeared to make sure they were to our satisfaction before we started.  There was no room for error there that couldn't be resolved before we started.  My friend had ordered a small steak. My friend is  quite elderly and Kathy, our server, discretely asked her if she'd like it cut for her.  A potato also was served with her dish.  I asked my friend which of the condiments she would like it prepared with.  She look at me and said ""Prepared with?"" She didn't understand what I was getting at but Kathy did and was already reaching for the potato.   She opened the potato and smiled while my friend said a bit of everything.  One doesn't go to a restaurant like the stockyards to have to deal with opening a hot potato and preparing it.   When serving is done properly, these things don't have to be discussed.  Kudos to, Kathy!!!.  That is part of the fine dining experience.I had a full rack of ribs which were so tender the meat fell of them.  The sauce had spice to it but not so strong the flavor of the meat was concealed.  I also can tell you that unless you are a big eater, half a rack would fill most people.  My friend said, ""Yummy!""  and I agreed.  I am used to getting a finger bowl for clean up after eating, but I can't complain about the two extra napkins and several ways of cleaning my fingers that accompanied my ribs.  My friend let them know we were celebrating the 17th anniversary of my 39th birthday so they served me a free desert.  I can assure you the pecan pie is a delight!  Warm and laced with brandy, it was perfect way to finish our dinner.The stockyards, I might mention, is not inexpensive, but what an enjoyable way to spend your money. They do offer two dinner specials you won't find at most other places.  They do have a luncheon menu that has lower prices.   Don't expect chrome and music that is a bit to loud as many of the new places offer.  Instead, just enjoy a time and place where they pamper you as you should be when you go to the Stockyards.I don't consider the stockyards to be a place you where shorts and Nike's, but of course there are always a few.  I would say a nice shirt and slacks at least.",review,4sIK_74UwkKU9YQXIfgCdg,2,3,0

The meals are creative and super tasty. Never disappointed. The only qualm I have is the service. It...is...slow. Whether it's the time it takes for my meal to reach my table or the cashier taking my order to ring it up correctly. The length of time it takes should not be so long. Prices are a bit steep but most vegetarian/vegan restaurants are priced a bit higher than others. I don't mind paying more for quality. Overall this place is a favorite weekend visit.

If you are looking for something more stimulating you may want to try their Irish Car Bombs. Or if you are you are up to it go with both.When your pasty arrives don't touch the plate! It could be scorching bloody hot.

I finally caught up with them at Local Fest.Bogi was actually there helping them out and she told me that they were only sampling the regular pizza and the gluten free pizza was $8 but she assured me it was yummy!  First of all $8 for a 2 item gf crust pizza is a deal!

I love breakfast food and the ""specialty"" won me over instantly; PROTEIN PANCAKES! As the timeless Tina Turner once said, ""Simply the Best!"".

To speak to something others have mentioned about getting the check early (while they are still eating); as long as you continue to be my waitress (i.e. refills, requests for jelly, etc.) I don't care if you bring the bill with the food. If I decide I want something else, I doubt any of the folks here would have a problem reprinting a corrected bill. Now on to the food!! The protein pancakes are filled with blueberries, granola, cinnamon and silvered almonds. The ingredients aren't something exotic, but they are perfectly balanced in the mix (not too much or too little of any of them). The thing about any food item you like at a restaurant, it becomes a favorite because they are able to duplicate it time after time. I have had this item many times (more than any other item), and they are always spot on (knock on wood) :). All the other dishes I have had (always breakfast, haven't tried lunch yet) were some combination of eggs and protein, and the eggs are always perfectly cooked to my specification (over medium), and the meat always juicy. I promise to write another review as soon as I don't get the protein pancakes (which will be when they decide to remove them from the menu - NEVER). :) Oh, or if I actually go in later than normal and feel like lunch over breakfast (not good odds :O).",review,puY1mdD4w4AwIYPrIyEhWw,2,2,2

I've had sushi in CA, NY, TX and HI.   The fish tastes fresh and the portions are generous.  One piece of advice is to eat at the sushi bar rather than one of the booths, assuming you are having sushi.

This place has the best Unagi and an awesome Escolar (which I haven't found anywhere else.)  The Suprise Crazy Roll, served with a sweet wasabi sauce, is always on our Sushi order.The only con is that this place is pricey, but they do have a daily 5-7 happy hour that contains some great options.

If you are looking for a veggie sandwich - you will be limited here.  But, if you like a hearty cheesesteak or italian sub you are in for a treat.  They also take a bit of a different approach in that they really douse their sandwiches in oil & vinegar.   It is a different approach but seriously good!  The ""Mike's Way"" option (lettuce, onions & tomatoes) is a bit bland, I love to add the mustard, mayo & pepperocini.Their signature sandwich is the #13.  It has several flavorful italian meats plus freshly sliced cheese.  Don't judge this place until you have tried that sandwich!  It is unlike any other chain's offering & really amazing.  Their sandwich sizes are a bit different from the regular foot-long, but if you order the largest size you are getting quite a bit for your money.  I've visited the one that just opened in Chandler and was completely pleased.  And, I'm happy to hear they are now opening one in Ahwatukee.They also seem to have a high focus on customer service - I've always been met by very cheerful, helpful people.

I've been meaning to try one of their cask conditioned ales, but they always seem to be out, probably indicative of the quality of those selections.The Food: fantastic!  I can't say that I've ever had a bad meal at Four Peaks.  The Italian Beef Beer Bread is the best thing on the menu, but you can't go wrong with the Chicken Fingers, Chicken Salad Pita, or really any of their sandwiches.  The fries are also great here - there's a little crispy coating on the outside that is quite tasty.  Oh, and the Spicy Thai Hummus is also a really good appetizer.  A little more liquidy than your average hummus, but really good.

Sometimes, if I'm really hungry, I order it with a side of their twice baked casserole (twice baked potato in a cup, basically. It's unbelievable.)

Service was in fine form-- I couldn't have the market-made maple syrup blend, nor any of the house-whipped cream, blueberry compote, raspberry and apricot jams, or any of the flavored syrups used at the coffee counter (my server patiently checked for those items we were unsure about), and when I asked for chocolate chips, I was, instead, offered a chocolate syrup made from scratch composed of chocolate, sugar, and coco oil... good stuff!  This syrup would be excellent on ice cream sundaes, too.  (FYI, I didn't really need anything extra to add to the pancakes and meatballs... the two paired well!)I've mentioned this once before, but I think it's such a great thing to yelp about again-- buy an espresso (or any of their specialty coffees), and you can have unlimited cups of regular coffee during your meal!  Not like I needed more caffeine after the double-shot, but I did have some of the house-blend coffee.  After 1.5 pancakes, the meatballs (watch out, they're very greasy!), and caffeine, I'll be good to go for a few hours, despite only having four hours of sleep!  (I'm hoping, anyway!)p.s.  Despite tipping more than 20% at the cashier upon ordering, I thought Bruce, the server who took care of me at my table, deserved a couple more bananas for not displaying annoyance at my staying here so long.  One more reason why I love Liberty Market so much!  Addendum:  After getting directions from Bruce as to the quickest way to 101 N, he asked me if I wanted a cup of coffee to go, gratis!

They have those great crinkle fries and they are made to order so they come out super crispy and hot. They alone can stand on their own but I have to have the sauce. It has to be a mixture of ketchup, mayo probably some chili powder and some other stuff that I can't figure out. No matter how many times I try to do it at home I never get it. Once before I got the Italian Beef but being my first time I didn't know that you could get it wet... Duh... and ended up eating a warm roast beef sandwich that was a bit on the dry side. After reading the Yelp reviews I realized that you can add all kinds of stuff to it. I think that the girl at the register should've at least informed me that I had options. The staff (girls at the register) weren't all too friendly which makes for a less than pleasant experience right from the start. Hopefully they aren't there anymore. Forward to today I decided to give it another shot and I am so glad I did. The owner is a really cool guy and is always super nice when I come in. He asked me all the questions about how I wanted the sandwich and put the dip in a to go cup for me so I wouldn't have a mush sandwich when I got home. I added provolone and hot giardiniera which absolutely made the sandwich. I didn't get to finish it because my other half smelled it and swooped in and polished it off and loved it too. Good thing I got the fries! I would highly recommend this place. If you do have the Italian Beef you should try to eat it there instead of taking it home. If you get embarrassed easily or worry about food all over your hands and face then don't eat this infront of other people. I think it once you eat it you won't even care if it gets in your hair.

I remember how I first heard of the place.... I was over at a friend's house in Scottsdale having a few beers after work, and remember asking him what his favorite Mexican restaurant in Phoenix was.  My friend, who had more than just a few beers in him, stared at me all glassy-eyed, got right in my face and said... ""Cheeeeno Banddddeeedo!!""  As I backed up a bit, thinking my friend had too much to drink (he had, for sure), I wondered... hmmm...the Chinese Bandit?  What the hell is that place about?!?  Or is he just f***ing with me?  So, I asked him what kind of food they serve there... And, as he did his best to focus on me, when his eyes hit mine, there was this long pause.... and he had this expression on his face that I can't forget... I wasn't sure if he was having trouble putting it into words or if he was sh***ing in his pants.   And then he put his hands together, like a nutjob working a Rubik's cube.... and said, ""They... dooo... things... like.... egg-foooo youngggg burrritos and jaaaade red chicken tacossssss....""..... as he gave me another crazy-ass look (the kind that tells you it's time to say goodnight and get outta there - which I did)....So, a few days later, I remembered his drunken explanation of Chino Bandido and thought I would go check the place out.... And from that point on, I was hooked.   Egg foo young burritos indeed!   And jerk fried rice!   And those refried black beans with fire-in-the-bungholio sauce mixed in.... Yep, those will burn you twice... All served in a giant disposable aluminum baking dish... And you got that combo, along with a soda and tip for about $10!!!   WOW!!  At that time, I had never seen anything like it before, and I still miss eating there more than any of my favorite old haunts in Phoenix....

But par for the course, no. First of all, they have an extensive wine list, which includes a rare type of sparkling wine, called Brachetto. In this area, DUI's are more common than a cold, and it's a light and tasty wine, with a low alcohol content. So it's option is great for me. It also goes great with everything they serve, because of it's unique flavor profile.Lizzie was our waitress, and offered options and suggestions, which actually saved us quite a bit of money on the whole. Not that, by any stretch of the imagination, is this a place to go when you are not intending a big splurge. This is a place to take it slow and spend slightly over a decent amount. The food, however, is absolutely worth it. We tried the Cheddar fondue, which could have used a bit more mustard powder and worstershire sauce, but on the whole was delicious. It was well prepped, and Lizzie explained what she was adding and why the whole time. The veggie selection is a bit mundane, and that's really my only complaint. We ate the ""big night out"" prix fix menu and chose the ""Fusion"" option which had lobster tail, shrimp, brats, ravioli, new york strip, sirloin steak, and a marinated chicken. We cooked it in the Boullion method which is just a flavored broth. Because it's not oil, you do need to add 30 sec to a min to the suggested cook times, but it was a lot lighter than using the oil and we didn't come home smelling like oil. The california salad was incredible. It had mixed greens, sliced roma tomatoes, chopped pecans, and blue cheese crumbles with a rasberry black walnut dressing. It's been a long time since I was able to truly enjoy a salad, and this was amazing. The chocolate we chose was the Smore. It was milk chocolate, marshmallow creme flambeed with grahm cracker bits added after the fire goes out. It's served with 2 types of coated marshmallows, pound cake, a slice of cheese cake, and a bowl of sliced strawberries and bananas. Just enough to fill us up, but we didn't overstuff ourselves. Our dinner was leisurely paced and took us about 2 to 2 1/2 hrs to get through. This is pretty normal for fondue. You do have the option of sitting at the bar and having just a cheese or chocolate, if you are on a time constraint though. It's located in a great little shopping and dining area that wasn't too crowed last night, but I think that was more due to the weather, than the actual popularity of the place.",review,5sTIqfZr45ZGEjanTXGZCg,0,1,0

1M4oczf2lmkdgbrJ3J7OqA,8/23/08,Qk5lp15fIkZoWVPnY4e0eA,5,"I rarely give 5 stars, as I believe it is very difficult to obtain a perfect score through food, beverage, service, ambiance, etc. Christopher's new venture is perfectly Christopher, 5 stars.First off a little background, Christopher is a native. That's right; he's a graduate of Central High School. He studied in France where he honed his craft and to this day draws his technique from. He has owned now three ventures in Phoenix, first his fine dining and bistro location on the northwest corner of 24st and Camelback (later became Eddie's by Eddie Matney, former hair dresser turned chef at Cous-Cous then Eddie's Grill) then after closing he moved to the restaurant row in The Biltmore Fashion Park, 2rd level to open Christopher's Fermier Brasserie & Paola's Wine Bar. Which in reading many reviews here on Yelp was unfortunately misunderstood. It makes me wonder if people understand what French is, it's not their fault though, there aren't many French restaurants in town, most have be closed, including Mary Elaine's at the Phoenician  and John Claude's Petite Cafe. There are a few that still survive Sophie's and Vincent's, but in this town of chains few people venture for French. Now with Christopher's Restaurant/Crush Lounge he has passed on the wine bar and opened a lounge instead. Christopher does enjoy lounges as he is a regular at Merc Bar, but then so is his smoked salmon which is offered on the Merc Bar menu. So a lounge makes sense, I'm a believer in a chef should open what they are passionate about. The new location has a different feel from his previous; his last venture echoed a French Countryside feel, as did the food. I think that was why many didn't understand it; yes it was French, but ALL FRENCH IS NOT FINE DINNING. I wish more understood that concept, but this is primarily a beer drinking state, not wine or rather more Mc D's not Mary E's! Hence there's a difference between filling your stomach and filling your soul and leaving a restaurant inspired with the feeling that life is wonderful. Christopher's is the latter. The design is contemporary with long lines of brushed stainless, white linen and exposed wooden beams. Kudos to whoever designed it, great job! The tables are dressed with white linen, elegant silver and polished stemware. You can't help but feel that it's 'time to dine' when seated. The walls in the main dining room have many vases of fresh flowers that seem to be replaced whenever necessary, nice touch.  The food at Christopher's is exactly what you'd expect, French, without the super-high-end prices. He's still one of the only chefs in town serving Foie Grass and Duck Confite, both wonderful and worth the trip if a glass of juice (wine) is added! I've been there now on 4 occasions and everything is fantastic, flavorful and prepared professionally. Christopher offers daily specials and I recommend them including; Veal Chop on Wednesdays, Roasted Duck on Thursday, Lamb Shank on Friday and Rabbit on Saturday. But don't stop at your entree, get the cheese course for dessert or for something sweet, the Chocolate Tower is one of the best desserts in town, hands down, no question.  Service is another point were Christopher sets himself apart. It doesn't get any better than this. Again it's NOT fine dining, so you can't compare it to fine dining restaurants (but then again there's only one left in the valley - Different Point Of View).  The servers know the food; they can describe anything on the menu and recite the specials as if their job depends on it (if you know Christopher it probably is).  Food is coursed correctly with a few minutes in between, as well as wine service is as professional as it gets. The bread service is as always, French breads with a super rich, euro butter, perfect for lapping up to sauce or vinaigrette remains on your plate.Needless to say, Christopher does it right, in my opinion, or is it just my opinion? Many of the valley's most celebrated chefs eat at Christopher's, he's know in many circles as the ""chef's chef"". But don't take my word for it, ask the chef at your favorite restaurant, who their favorite chefs are in town, and favorite restaurants, most likely Christopher will make the list!Here's the web address:  http://www.christophersaz.com/The website is limited; menu, wine list, press release and pictures of the restaurant...",review,3f_-pGlAZi6a6ZySrsspVQ,5,7,2

She told us we had only a few minutes to order because the kitchen would be closing and that the pizza oven was already off. No worries, we remain unfazed. We sat at a high top next to the bar, there were a few other people at tables nearby, some drinking coffee and one couple enjoying the bruschetta and some wine on a leather sofa by the large fireplace. The room hits just the right notes for me, warm and inviting, nice art but not overpowering - its a place I could hang out in. We both had a nice glass [generous pour] of a Voga Pinot Gris and a sandwich. I had smoked salmon, Jeff had roast beef. The smoked salmon was a generous portion with capers, cuke and tomato and a what seemed to be a seasoned mayo [not goat cheese as the online menu suggests but a nice and savory compliment just the same] on a toasted baguette. Roast beef was similar in scale, lots of meat with melted cheddar, greens also on a toasted baguette. Each was served with a side of chips and a pickle. It may have been me or just the mood I was in but I really felt relaxed there and in spite of the fact that we closed the place for the afternoon, we didn't feel rushed or in the way.

Kinda weird, but the employees in the other businesses are lucky!We went in here on a whim after reading all the awesome Yelp reviews.  Our first impression was a girl at the front and she was super nice and didn't rush us while we were checking out the menu options.I ordered the pulled pork sandwich with macaroni & cheese and my husband ordered the brisket sandwich with a side of baked beans.  He also ordered a side of ribs to sample.  The wait wasn't too bad -- it took about 10 or 15 minutes and it was ready to go.  They are cool with their sauce and let you fill up the small plastic cups and take as much as you want of it (which is awesome, because the sauce tastes SO good!).   It's a nice, thick sauce and they have several flavors to choose from.We go to a nearby area to have a little picnic by ourselves and notice that they forgot to include the side of ribs.  We pack everything up and go back to get those.  The employees were really nice about it and apologized and gave my husband the side of ribs.  We repeat the same process and realize that they also messed up my husband's order and gave him a pulled pork sandwich instead of the brisket sandwich.  We decide to let it go and eat our food.The pulled pork has great flavor.  The meat actually tastes like it has been smoked for several hours and is good enough to eat on its own without any sauce.  However, we weren't going that route, because the sauce is too damn good not to eat.  The baked beans and macaroni & cheese were not anything special, but they were good.  The ribs were our favorite part!  We absolutely loved them.  Very tender and the sauce they chose to slather them in was delicious.This place is pretty far from where we live, but we would definitely go out of our way (again) to eat here more.",review,4wrWwXn81EKt7ODuq6D1Uw,2,1,0

Most items were in the $10-15 range, and I was immediately intrigued by the various pizza selections.  I focused my sights on the garden pizza, which took me by surprise because it was basically a chef-tossed salad on a really good pizza crust.  My girlfriend went with the bruschetta planks and chose two homemade pesto, one mozarella basil, and one roasted artichoke - DELICIOUS!Top that off with a few glasses of really good sangria and you've got a really good meal for right around the $40-50 mark.

UxvOXcoCRFRAVhRB0D9imw,2/25/08,Mtgnj4dH9RE_zLGSTHyY2A,5,"Definitely one of my new favorite restaurants!A friend and I went to lunch there last week and it was even better than I expected after reading the other reviews.  The menu is EXTREMELY extensive.  The b-fast all day long is a plus, but I wasn't in the mood for that this time so I stuck to the lunch menu.  I ended up ordering the half sandwich and soup of the day and my friend and I split a side order of sweet potato fries.  The eggplant and roasted veggie sandwich was really good, but huge and messy!  I ended up eating a lot of bread and then eating the insides that fell out with a fork after wards.  Delicious nonetheless.  The homemade chicken noodle soup was outstanding!  It had lots of other bits of veggies that are not traditionally in the soup (red pepper, green pepper, corn, etc.) and it added to the soup quite nicely.  Did I forget to mention it's a GIGANTIC bowl of soup?  There's no little cup o' soup here - come hungry!  The fries were delicious although we didn't even need them since our meals were ""Hungry Man"" sized.Some side notes:1.  Parking is awful for lunch.  If you don't mind creepily stalking folks in the parking lot and possibly engaging in an altercation with another patron attempting to park, go ahead and give it the good ol' college try.2.  I ordered a water with lemon.  I received a water with no lemon.  When I asked for some lemons for my water, they brought me out a small plate with SIX (yes, I really did say six) overgrown lemon wedges.  I tried to come up with a scenario where one person would possibly have a need for one entire lemon on steroids.  I couldn't come up with one.  There is no reason for one person to be in possession of that much lemon.  Period.3.  We walked in and staff #1 seated us.  Staff #2 took our order.  Staff #3 brought our drinks and later the pile of lemons.  Staff #4 brought our meal.  Staff #5 cleared our plates.  Staff #6 brought our check.  Staff #3 took our check and brought the receipts/change back.  Did it really take 6 people to get us through a weekday lunch?  I was mostly entertained by it - it almost became a game of ""who will show up next and what is their task?""  It was still a little ridiculous.4.  Being a semi-health conscious diner, I loved that they had fat free dressings, made tuna salad with low fat mayo, and just had many, many more healthy options than the average restaurant.  I appreciate places that can fix a good meal without drenching it in calories and fat.  There are plenty of places to go for that sort of meal when you're in need.  No shortage there.  It's nice to have those options beyond the standard no dressing, burger wrapped in lettuce, or vegetable medley consisting of zucchini, carrots, and cauliflower.  A big up for Taylor's.5.  For a half sandwich with soup, half of the fries, tax, and tip I paid about $16.  It's not the cheapest lunch in town, but it's worth what you pay for.  Just remember that the portions are gargantuan so no need to order a lot of extras to fill you up.I will definitely be back again.  Enjoy!",review,#NAME?,3,5,2

I had a chicken burrito (my Chipotle norm) so I could make as direct of a comparison as possible.  The food was great, and afterwards I didn't get that ""punched in the stomach"" feeling that Chipotle gives me for some time after I eat it (I am convinced their rice expands in your stomach, but it tastes good so I suffer through it).  I also picked up their frequent customer swipe card (buy 10 burritos get one free + free chips and salsa after activation).  This place is closer to my place than any Chipotle, so I will be coming very often! P.S. If anyone if privy to the correct pronunciation let me know!(ku-doh-ba???)",review,5E193w76Qlhoi1gkyakW2A,0,1,0

(Meatball pizza was a hit for the younger one; the older one shared sausage pizza and mussels.) The food came very quickly. We had all small plates and pizza, not entrees: kale chips, fried chickpeas, peppers, mozzarella salad. Dessert was great. The mousse was first rate, and the parsnip creme brul̩e was delicious (though we couldn't taste any parsnip; it just tasted like excellent, flavorful creme brul̩e). One of the best meals we had in Arizona. And we also really liked the decor. Simple, elegant, and also fun/creative. Not sure why anyone would ding them for that. Also, the portion sizes were just fine. We all left full but not feeling gross. We're from MA, and were unaware of the chef's celebrity. I wonder if some of the griping here is just celebrity bashing, or a reaction against some sort of hype? I'm outside that loop, but it just struck us as an excellent and fun place with great food and no pretension. Just thorough competence. Note: It's a nice walk from the Arizona Biltmore Hotel.

Don't be fooled by the shabby looks of the outside plaza; the inside is contrarily well orchestrated with subtle Thai ornaments and design. A huge desk in the lobby and bigger one inside the dining hall gives this establishment an odd but distinct hotel feel. Much like that feeling, the service is intriguingly exceptional from the time you walk into the front door. The food that I've tried here so far is... may I say it... divine. I started off with the squid salad with mint and lemongrass and it was packed with fish sauce and shrimp paste. Score. I also tried some papaya salad and once again, it was mounded in fish sauce and chili. Splendid. Then I had the minced beef phad kaprow (which is not on the menu) and lo and behold, I was tasting Phuket in a Bangkok sort of way. To be honest... the sauces from each of these entrees mingle quite well. You can drizzle some of each dripping over rice and literally have an orgy in your mouth of Mormonic proportions. You can also bolster it with some more heat with their chili fish sauce, again drizzled all over your concoction. Let your adventurous mind roam free and order something outside the pad thai genre. It will pay off handsomely.",review,PiIdsdEd8JrRaMv5aDzSZA,1,2,1

Greeted by a valet who had plenty of energy and was very informative. We picked the elevator to go to the 4th floor as opposed to the stairs... We were seated in a corner window table with views beyond belief! Greeted by our server , Larry, he wished my husband Happy Birthday and brought a passion fruit drink that was delish compliments of the Chef! Nice touch... Ask for Larry if you go.. he was right in tune with our special requests... We ordered their Signature Salad and I said we would share it... Larry had the kitchen serve it as a split.. Larry made the dinner and celebration very Special. My husband ordered the Rib Eye but my husband doesn't like any thing on his rib eye and doesn't like anything else on his plate with the meat.. Larry must hears this all the time and he explained exactly how it will be plated and assured him that no sauce or veggies would touch the meat. See pictures to see our meals. I held my breath until the plates came out and my Husband loved it- it was perfect. He ordered it medium rare and it came out perfectly cooked and full of flavor and it cut like butter. I ordered the Pork Tenderloin and it was tender and full of flavor the corn cakes were like little polenta pancakes they were delishish...

Nor the service, which is friendly and helpful. Nor about the atmosphere (well, somewhat about the atmosphere...it's quite lackluster). My concern is that Heirloom claims to be fine dining for our current economic times, when $50 entrees seem obscene. But what they've done is create a menu of less expensive small plates where you need to order at least 3 per person to be totally full, so you end up spending as much if not more as you would at other high-end establishments. On my visit, the place was practically dead. Granted, it was a weeknight, but I can't see how a place can survive with only 3 of its probably 15+ tables occupied. Especially not in such a high rent location, where restaurants have dropped out like flies. The menu changes weekly, which is really nice if you go to a place often, but who could possibly afford to come here often?! If you do go, they have a $25 off coupon on their website. Not 25 percent...25 DOLLARS! I would love to return to Heirloom every month to try chef Michael DeMaria's latest culinary creations, but that's certainly not within my budget.

Its good to see an establishment take risks with seasoning their food. It was fresh! Which is hard to find these days and I'm pretty sure the people who own Arribas own a hatch chile farm because I rarely saw anything about jalapenos or serranos or even habaneros. Which is cool. Those hatch chiles are slanged around that place like coke in studio 54 in the 70's. I'm not kidding, when you order your entree and they ask you what kind of beans you want. Black, pinto, or the 3rd kind that is a combo of black/pinto with some onion, tomatoes, and of course, what's that? Hatch chiles! I highly recommend them. I liked how Arribas uses the hatch chiles.

Because the people that work at any restaurant know the food/drinks there more than you will ever know. 'Nuff said. He brought out some margarita I don't even know the name.

I on the other hand PROMOTE this thought process. I don't want food that's bland that a place kicks off the line to the people outside than enjoy bland food. That makes for a BLAND place that's filled with, well, bland people. This place uses heat, salt, pepper, and other spices that I don't know of. What a freaking great idea! Too hot for you?

As if that wasn't enough to make a fan out of me, I found out they serve $2 Blue Moons all day Saturday and the food is awesome!The burgers are great, and you can order them rare if you like. I also became addicted to their BBQ chicken sandwich. And the wings. They'll grill them instead of fry them for you which is a bonus. In fact I don't thing there is anything that I have tried and disliked here.Thursday-Sunday night they usually have a pretty decent cover band. Usually classic rock or 80s stuff. They also have NTN and a ton of TVs if you're into sports.I was so in love that when it came time to move from my apartment, I made sure my new house was within walking distance. Not that you'd need to walk, (since half the year it is hot as hell even at 2am I can see why you wouldn't want to walk) they offer a free ride program on the weekends where they'll pick you up and drop you off. That way you don't have to worry about Sheriff Joe and wearing pink undies at Tent City.Wow, I kinda wanna move back now. CK's I miss you!!!",review,B-Q5eu19iZ1QZ8UKf9siUw,1,1,1

My sandwich came out perfectly, from the fresh Ciabatta Bread to the outstanding roasted pork. I would order this pork just by itself; it was juicy, and full of flavor, just like my Cuban grandmother makes. While this sandwich is a true Cuban sandwich, not using swiss, and not being pressed, it is not advertised as an actual Cuban, just a Cuban style, like me.Now this potato salad was some of the best I have ever had, and not just because it had bacon, which is awesome, but the use of yukon gold potatoes, instead of red, or russets has been a revelation to me. This is how I am going to prepare all off my potato salads from now on.After all that I still ordered the carrot cake, which like everything else is made in house with local ingredients, it was warm with a not overly sweet cream cheese frosting. The wife got the lava cake with some beer ice cream. Even though I ate most of my carrot cake, and loved it, I wish I had a full gallon of that beer ice cream, it was just perfect.

corPOxxIBRJ7DSpryYvorw,12/4/08,qSEMTr86RSjlOsedZhXb_g,5,"Wow. Wow Freakin' Wow.I have never, ever had such a perfect dining experience from the minute they greet you, learn your name, cater to your every need, and give you FABULOUS, beautifully prepared food since...well, NEVER. I must say I did do my research, so I did know what I wanted to try and even though I kind of expected the JW Marriott to be more of a snooty place, I felt it would be closest to my house and wanted to find out for myself what all the hoopla was about this Roy person and his fish.I went with my friend Amy who was visiting from New York. She had been to Roy's before and is a fellow foodie. We got to the restaurant early and went outside on the immense patio area to sit and have a drink. It's December so a bit chilly but the HUGE, soft patio furniture was extremely cozy and we sat and had $20 martinis (LOADED with vodka. Warning: We had to ask for more fruit juice! And we are major drinkers - just gotta throw that in there.) Our waitress on the patio could not have been more accomodating and she even brought us new martinis even though we drank quite a bit of our strong ones. I am a people watcher and it was nice to see that there was an assortment of people sitting on the furniture, some of them looked like they could be relatives of mine, enjoying the late afternoon, reading, conversing....well, if I HAD any rich or classy relatives, that is. It was very nice and relaxing. Plus the Mariott property is stunning and I wish I could have looked around the property more than we did.When we meandered inside for dinner, the hostess greeted us by name and our server showed us to our table. She was very competent, could make recommendations, and was pleasant without being clingy. We loved her. She reminded me of Joan Cusack. Sounded just like her!The complimentary appetizer of lightly spiced, steamed edamame was delightful and even though they gave us warmed wet washcloths we were complete heathens and ate with our hands without ever using them.We shared the Roy's Canoe for Two, which had Lobster potstickers, Beef Satay, shrimp on a stick (not its real name), and Tuna Sushi Rolls. I must say - the Lobster potstickers - better than sex. The Beef satay was basically this ultra-tender beef on a stick, lightly flavored and grilled. Fabulous. But the pinnacle of perfection here was the Tuna sushi rolls, which absolutely knocked our socks off. I have never, ever had such an amazing piece of sushi before that moment. I think our  server, Joan Cusack (Not her real name) thought I was choking because as I ate it, my eyes were rolling back into my head in ecstacy.  She bustled over and once she got closer she could see she was merely interrupting a very intimate moment with me and my tuna roll and she went back to her post after giving me a thumbs-up sign. For whatever reason, these tuna sushi rolls were encrusted in what may have been macadamia nuts and it was completely divine. I re-live that moment over and over. MMM.But you know, the showstopper was STILL yet to come. I could not believe my luck when my Roy's Trio was placed in front of me. It was a piece of Hawaiian butterfish in Miso sauce, a piece of Seared Ahi, and a piece of salmon. The poor salmon! It was the best salmon I ever had out, but next to those two it was like Cinderella's ugly stepsister. Just upstaged by the butterfish, which is melt-in-your mouth decadence, and the seared ahi - which surpassed the tuna roll I just got done fantasizing about as the most perfect piece of sushi EVER.Amy got the butterfish. We licked our plates clean. Amy tried my Ahi and declared it, like I did, the BEST seared Ahi on the planet.For dessert, you KNOW I had to have the molten chocolate souffle. How good was it?? Brad Pitt could have walked up naked to our table and I would not have looked up long enough to stop shoveling it into my face.Amy ordered the 3 creme brulees - one had a Hawaiian orchid on it, and they were not only lovely but they tasted amazing. The coconut one was so fresh and it made me think that THIS is what every coconut cream pie in the world needs to taste like. I think the other flavors are vanilla bean (very good too) and maybe rum? (also very good) It may not sound like I am doing the dessert justice but when you've been kissing George Clooney for an hour then along comes Rick Springfield, which one is better? They are both amazing, but by the time Rick comes along, well, you're kind of spoiled already.Roy's could not have been better - this entire experience was an A++ through and through. The staff was extremely helpful (someone walked me to the ladies room when I merely asked where it was) (Oh and need I mention the corwn molding in the bathroom stalls was nicer than the crown molding in my house???) (And you know you are in a classy joint when a basket of tampons and maxi-pads is out on the marble bathroom counter, like party favors for down under)THUMBS WAY UP!!!",review,IXaxy5NZ_ku8rkXt04lxVQ,2,2,4

A non-traditional, very out there, but very hidden coffee joint.You can't see this place from the street. It's kind of behind the Buffalo Exchange. It's almost the last place you would expect to find a coffee shop. As soon as you walk in there are really bright and vivid paintings, this is kind of what makes it way out there. Barista was very friendly and asked us how the weather was, always cool to have some small talk instead of the drone, ""what can i get for you..."" Wait, that basically sounds like the boring coffee-grinders at Starbucks.I gotta have my lattes. I will drink regular coffee sometimes, but my soft spot is a well made latte. Amazing enough, places like Starbucks just don't know how to make lattes, I give up on Starbucks. Their beans suck, and apparently their frothing machines do too, because everytime I go there it seems like they just warm my milk and mix it with some coffee. The latte here was PERFECT. The milk was perfectly frothy, which in my opinion is what makes a latte a latte. Coffee had a nice roasted flavor to it. Amazingly, there are tons of coffee shops out there that can't do decent lattes. This is my new coffee place.Good music choice here, its like new age elevator music, calm soothing hip hop and pop. Awesome atmosphere, quiet enough to study and have a conversation, yet lively enough to come for just a cup of caffeine. Skip the Starbucks and ""Sex in the City"" sorority girl drinks and come here.Only problem was that I think they only have small or large lattes, and it was like $4 for a large. That's like $0.50 to a $1 too much in my honest opinion. Oh well, I think I'd still pay that when I'm craving a latte.",review,LHQ2fuC2RDS-Md_dN2O1IQ,0,1,0

I am quite certain it is the only thing we have in common.This is where I take my foodie friends because they are usually so busy eating they shut up for a while. (I kid, I kid...) I have never had anything here that I don't find super delicious and crave-worthy. The first time I went here my party was personally doted on by Maurizio, who was over-the-top gracious and seemed to truly love what he was doing.  While I don't see him every time I am here, the service never suffers.The calamari is crisp and light, which is a nice change from heavy, fried calamari that is so ubiquitous in too many Italian joints. Hands down my favorite item on the menu is the Frescolina. The combination of the arugula and prosciutto makes my mouth water even thinking about it!So next time you are at Pizza-A-Metro, my advice is don't loudly discuss if the portly man next to you is Joe Arpaio. Don't look him up on your Blackberry and pass the photo around to get the opinion of your fellow diners. Don't bring up that his mother died in childbirth, and how that potentially explains a great deal of the man's 'politics.' No matter how much wine you have had, do not forget how small this restaurant is. Because in the end, after he and his bodyguards leave, the server will tell you- Yeah.

Sounds simple, but it's nice when you have nice black pants on and don't want white crap all over them.  Second, the food was great.  The duck fries were really good (and free)... I had a great corn chowder with cilantro and a small grilled cheese sandwich which was perfect. (I never eat those). My main course was a skirt steak in a fantastic sauce.  My dessert was beignets and creme brulee.  The beignets were great and the creme brulee was good.

We also tried the figs stuffed with chorizo.  Also very good & savory.  But the ABSOLUTE FAVORITE of the night were the chicken and waffles!  My gosh is this the dish to come to the Tuck Shop for.  The chicken was deliciously seasoned and had the perfect fry on the outside and moist chicken on the inside.  The waffles were served with a butter that seemed to be whipped with possibly honey and the syrup was just the right sweet.  All the flavors seemed to work with just the right amount of sweet and savory.  The grilled fresh green beans were the perfect side.  I think I would get this dish over and over and over again.  Then I would go back and get it again.  Great place we will frequent often.  P.S. They make their own tonic.  Yep, their own tonic.  GREAT tasting!

WNy1uzcmm_UHmTyR--o5IA,7/10/12,uWOai947MVYIhiQGstsdhQ,5,"Just fantastic. I first went to Cornish Pasty in 05' a few months after they opened and fell in love immediately. Although a few things have changed over the years each one is usually an improvement and never a negative. If you are not familiar, a pasty is a traditional British coal miners food.  A hearty filling wrapped in a pie crust and baked. Kind of a hand-held meat pie. Cornish Pasty Co. has taken this simple and traditional dish and meticulously perfected each component. Their crusts are some how simultaneously hearty and flaky. Although their is nothing delicate about their seasoning it is never out of balance and all of the ingredients are always quality. Beyond just mastering the finer details of pasty science, Cornish Pasty Co. has also branched off into wild and exotic flavors. It's no shocker that the British know Indian food and it shows with the tika masala and the lamb vindaloo pasties. What is shocking is the refinement of the Greek and Italian inspired pasties. Perhaps my favorite pasty, from the cuisine most elusive to the British, is the Carne Avadado. This is a Mexican inspired pasty that will satisfy even the most snobby Las Cruses/El Paso foodie. If you have ever talked Mexican food with one you will know just what I mean. I have eaten nearly every item on the menu and not a one disappoints. It took me ages to get past the pasties and start ordering soups and salads. Now that I have had the spinach, mushroom, walnut soup, it is hart to save room for my old favorites. Although the mine shaft inspired interior is dark and cramped I have never felt uncomfortable there. The sound system is usually bumping classic rock and the employees are pierced and tattooed well beyond your typical wait staff, but everyone is friendly and service is typically good.If I have to list a negative the only one I can think of is the food is consistently just a little better at the University location than the Dobson one.  No clue why, but everyone I've talk to seems to agree, the Tempe store has the edge on quality.  After you add a respectable selection of beers the only reason you won't be here every night is your waist line.",review,ehhIzy0QaQ9B-V4VVMgYmQ,0,1,0

This Fuddruckers special-orders the Sweet & Spicy variety of Tabasco which is not only great on a burger, but would work as an egg-roll dipping sauce.

That's not easy to pull off, considering the variety of the menu.But, while you are between courses, Chef Binkley will send out numerous amuse bouche - which, if you don't know, are tiny little one bit or one gulp appetizers like, mini sliders the size of a half dollar, or pancetta mousse in a shot glass.We ate there for my ex-H's bday, and had 8 amuse bouche.

It's like eating at Mom's house, if Mom happens to be Swedish.I've had a few of the entrees -- schnitzel cordon bleu, pork medallions, seared gravlax -- and all were delicious.  Especially the gravlax.The sides are also great, and you usually get three per meal.The poutine is perhaps not as good as what you'd get in Quebec, but it's easily the best I've had in Arizona.  The fact that they even have poutine wins this place a few points.I have also had the opportunity to try their dessert specialty, the Beaver Supreme.  This mess of chocolate, meringue, cream, mandarin orange, and possibly a few other things, is the sort of thing which you set out intending to only eat half in the first sitting, but ultimately find your free will diminished, invariably resulting in an empty dish and a fear of the onset of diabetes.Also, it seems one gentleman gave this place low marks for the long preparation time on a chicken wrap.  I just have to ask, why would anyone go to a Scandinavian restaurant and order a chicken wrap?  Can you imagine what would happen if you wander into a Viking camp and order a chicken wrap?

Not even because he has found something that completes his very living soul. It's special because he is simply, and utterly....happy.Ladies and Gentleman of Yelp....I have found the pizza that makes me happy.I heard all the hype...""best pizza in the country"", ""Oprah says it's the best"", ""The Food Network hypes it up"", ""Chris Bianco learned how to make pizza from Jesus"". Ok, I made up the last one.My friend and pizza aficionado, Lance has been known to drive in from Los Angeles...just for this pizza, and then he would drive home. Sometimes, he'd even fly in. It had to be good, right? Tonight, I chose Pizzeria Bianco for my birthday dinner because of the hype. I had made a pathetic attempt to dine here once, but myself and the individual I was with, we both were intimidated by the 3 hour wait. Is any pizza worth three hours? That's a personal judgment call. That night, I ended up dining at Nobuo, across the path....and it was a nice meal.I digress. I've been preparing for this trip. I read up on various press articles, and discovered that as of last week, they are open for lunch AND Mondays! Perfect. Tonight, I dined with my parents. My favorite dining companions. We sat down in the very intimate dining space. No wait at all. Perhaps, people don't know that they are open on Mondays. Fine by me.The decor is nice. Simple, with a classic cucina feel. The brick oven is the star of this place. Clearly.We ordered some bread to get started. It came with a little cup of high end olive oil. Fantastic! The crust was crisp, and the bread was chewy to the point where you can't help but smile when you eat this.The pizza is phenomenal. We ordered two pizzas (for three people). One was half Rosa and half Margherita, the other was the Biancoverde.  This way we were able to try three different kinds of pizza .All three styles were phenomenal. The winner of the three was the Margherita. The tomato sauce doesn't overpower, the mozzarella melts like a dream, and a hint of basil. The Rosa was unique, and also delicious. The Arizona pistachios take some getting used to, but pairs well with the red onion. The Biancoverde was much more complex. Definitely a hearty pizza because of the ricotta cheese. Very tasty. It's topped with arugala, so you will get a nice earthy, and loud flavor. Usually when I eat pizza, I take a bite of the crust, and then I leave the rest. Not here. I went through the entire pizza slice because it's perfect. Chewy, crispy, and full of happy!Take it from me....this place is worth the hype. Look at the reviews from other Yelpers. Even the picky ones love this place.Maybe it's true. Maybe Chris Bianco did learn how to make pizza from Jesus. Sure as hell tastes like it.Now if you are wondering about the other stuff, it was also a five star experience: staff friendly and attentive, and the bathrooms are spotless.Worth the 3 hour wait? YES. Bring all your friends here? YES. Will I guarantee the awesome? YES.#300",review,8JC-Yb3UDUv2FUl5ym1nVg,10,11,10

Ordered a bacon havarti burger with fries and a coke; it came out to just over 9 bucks.  The burger came with lettuce, tomato, cucumber (???), pickled red onions, and thousand island.  It was DELICIOUS.  Beautifully toasted bun, great char on the meat.  The pickled onions were a nice touch.  The fries were skinny and crispy and had seasoned salt, which brings me back to being a kid and getting fries at the food court in the mall (good memories).  I got a refill on my coke before I left, so I don't know what another reviewer was talking about when they said there are no refills on sodas.  I asked and it was no problem.My only gripe is that after I had ordered and sat down to wait for my food, a couple of guys came in and the guy at the counter immediately handed them paper menus (with actual descriptions of the menu items I'm sure, unlike the chalkboard on the wall), which I would have liked.  I probably would have gotten an add-on for my burger if he had given me a paper menu when I was at the counter.

Great start.Our next course we shared two salads - an octopus carpaccio and field green salad.  Both good.My main course was AMAZING.

I asked and was told that the fisherman they buy from are committed to sustainable methods, but I'm not sure (personally, for me, at least) that it is possible to sustainably fish a stock that is in danger.All in all though, a fantastic night and i can't wait to return!",review,CaU3GiAgTRhZwUZABIaFNQ,1,2,0

I go here at least a couple times a month for lunch and it's spectacular 95% of the time. A few of our favorite items are the BBQ ""Chicken"" sandwich, Thee Argentine sandwich, the crab puffs and of course, the Tsoynamis. Everything is fairly priced ($8 for a sandwich, $7.50 for a bowl w/ your choice or rice or noodles). The only thing I don't particularly care for is the buffalo wings as I think they are far too salty. The ranch that it comes with is fantastic, though. Also, if you get something with cheese make sure to use Daiya instead of Teese. Daiya tastes much better, in my opinion.The atmosphere is very artsy. There are always paintings for sale and there are a bunch of old car doors and hub caps over to one side. They just got a few booths which is fantastic if you want a little privacy. There is free wifi, a booshelf will all sorts of great reading, and the staff is always super friendly.Another great thing about Green is the vegan market. They have all sorts of great vegan foods and books for you to spoil yourself with. It's the only place I know of where you can find Teese, Food for Lovers Queso and Soy Curls. As an aside, I highly recommend Soy Curls as a healthy replacement to the meat in your fajitas or cheesesteaks.Another thing you absolutely must check out is their annual ThanksLIVING festival on Thanksgiving. They will load you up will all sorts of delicious and traditional Thankgsiving day food, veganized. ""Turkey"", stuffing, biscuits, brussels sprouts, asparagus, cranberry sauce, gravy, corn, pie and a drink. You'll get guest speakers, live music and local arts and crafts.

It's a little hole in the wall type place.  The kind you would drive by and never even notice if you weren't looking for it.  The pho has some of the best tasting broth and is a good portion.  It's about average price if not closer to the cheapest I have found.  It comes with a good sized plate of sprouts, basil, mint, lime, and jalapeno.  The spring rolls that I get have pork and shrimp in them and are a pretty good size.  The peanut sauce that comes with them for dipping tastes almost like fresh made peanut butter and has fresh ground pieces of peanut in it.  The service is fairly quick and very friendly, even with the fact that there is some language barrier.  I was actually taken to this place for the first time by an ex-coworker of mine who is an old vietnamese guy.

#NAME?,8/13/12,dfbCyy0y_jzeWotFcEuEuw,5,"With a few hours past and a few tasks accomplished the next stop of my day would be at Pane Bianco - the sandwich shop from the Valley's most celebrated Chef, Chris Bianco.  Having made my pilgrimage to the eponymous pizzeria during my first trip to Phoenix, Pane had been on my radar since the day I moved to town but given the lunch-only hours and my office location in North Scottsdale I knew a weekend would be best and as luck would have it a new website (http://www.pizzeriabianco.com/) and seven day 11a-3p schedule had been rolled out just the week prior.Arriving at the surprisingly large space (especially when compared to Matt's and JoBot from earlier that day - and compared to Pizzeria Bianco as well) shortly after 11:30 and allocating parking in the free lot juxtaposing the Light Rail I debated for a moment whether dine-in or to-go was best and opting for the former made my way into the restaurant where two couples already sat.  Greeted by one of two servers it was suggested I could take ""any seat I wanted"" and opting for a bench in the center of the room where a menu awaited I sat down to browse the menu as well as the daily specials listed on the chalkboard - almost all sounding appealing, but a bit different than the Saturday special listed on the website.  With a small list of beverages available I was asked soon if I was ready to order or if I needed a few minutes I deferred and requested a glass of water that would never reach even half-empty despite me drinking from it consistently and the restaurant soon filling to capacity.Having debated the specials but eventually undeterred from the reason I'd come in the first place I soon placed my order for a sandwich and an 'appetizer' which I was told would be 'just a few minutes' and as while I waited I checked out the small market at the Take Away section featuring the famous focaccia, cans of tomatoes, dried pasta, and apparel before returning to my seat where my items would arrive shortly - the first a Manchego and Tomato Sauce Focaccia del Giorno featuring Bianco's delectable wood fired focaccia in all of its spongy glory topped with sweet, ripe tomatoes and an ample layer of briny Manchego; at $4.50 probably the most expensive ""Grandma Slice"" I've ever had yet at the same time also probably the best...or at least on par with that at DiFara in Brooklyn for best of its genre.Moving next to the original target of my desire, a sandwich of Bianco's House Made Mozzarella, Tomatoes, and Basil on Wood Fired Focaccia my first thought was ""wow - that is a lot of cheese"" while my second, after a bite, was ""wow - that is a lot of flavor.""  Perhaps as pure of a sandwich as you can find and the result of exquisite ingredients on top quality bread there is really nothing 'special' about the composition of this sandwich aside from the fact that it simply works - a largely unmanipulated masterpiece only improved by a touch of sea salt and cracked black pepper.Largely unaware on entering that Pane serves dessert it was with much delight that I realized soon after sitting down that three options were available that day and while the flourless chocolate cake I saw emerge from the kitchen to the table next to me looked quite nice there was simply no way I was passing up the Organic Vanilla Bean Rice Pudding with Candied Pecans - another simplistic stunner with creamy Arborio rice imbued with a rich vanilla custard flicked with whole vanilla beans and a few pecans for crunch.  Delicate and smooth, flavorful without being overly sweet, and *almost* thick enough to stand a spoon up straight it was not quite the best rice pudding I've ever had - but a top five contender without a shadow of a doubt - a reason in and of itself to return to Pane Bianco...though to be fair, if I returned it would take pretty spectacular daily specials to prevent me from ordering the exact same trio of items once again.  With Chris and his team now two for two it is only a matter of time before I make my way to Italian Restaurant... and honestly, that time is likely measured in hours and days as opposed to weeks and months.",review,5lq4LkrviYgQ4LJNsBYHcA,3,6,2

Nice tables & chairs, candles, shelves with wine bottles and art, and a very nice bar.An Iranian family owns the restaurant and cooks everything themselves. That's the first sign of a high-quality establishment. They were incredibly nice to us and brought us whatever we needed. They gave us some good suggestions, like their Iced Black Tea, which is fantastic. It has a few other elements to it including Lavender. They brought us extra pita when we ordered some appetizers as well without us even asking.For our appetizers, we tried the hummus and the tabooli. The hummus was very creamy but a little plain. We wished there was more flavor or spice to it. Not a big deal. That was the only part of our meal that was not 5 stars, but 4 stars. The tabooli....ridiculous. I've never been a fan of tabooli. It usually has too much parsley. But their version was balanced perfectly.For an entree, I tried the Chicken Shawarma and we split a side of Basmati rice with saffron. A huge plate of rice with great seasoning. The saffron and olive oil gave the fluffy rice great texture. The Shawarma was fresh and delicious. The chicken was cooked and seasoned nicely.For dessert, we tried the Persian vanilla ice cream with rose water and saffron as well as the Baghlava. The ice cream was some of the best we've had. Great flavor. The Baghlava was a great complement to the ice cream. A nice sweetness from the honey and the flaky dough was great.So in summary, great atmosphere, great owners, out-of-this-world food, and very affordable. Everything we had came to about $32. We will return many times in the future because their menu is very promising. Just wish their name fit the type of place that it is. The current name makes it sound like just another Middle Eastern restaurant, which it definitely is not.",review,j-aruJbrUGLP4ZwhQfDJHw,1,2,0

I see Sushi Chefs from other restaurants coming here to eat during their off time. =)The prices are very reasonable, and all of the rolls and sashimi are very fresh and crafted to perfection by the old timers.The Ramen Noodle Bowl is awesome, and nothing like what you would buy in the grocery store. It is topped with pork, fish cake, bamboo, and seaweed. I highly recommend.They even have a fried salmon skin roll, which was very flavorful and not always available at every establishment. I wish that i would have taken a picture of the last one that I purchased, it was absolutely perfect.They also offer Takoyaki, which is like an octopus dumpling ball. You would have no idea that it contained octopus unless you were familiar with the dish. these are absolutely amazing and highly addictive. You have to try these during your visit.The last time that I was there, I had to try the Ichigo Mochi Ice Cream. It was green tea ice cream, surrounded by a rice flour shell and topped with whipped cream. It really hit the spot and I was so full but in a happy and satisfying way.If you like Sushi, and you think that RA is cool, hit yourself on the head for being a complete fool and go check this place out and get schooled on what fresh authentic Sushi is all about.

cOUS79i4vltKIc_hy4OZBg,11/6/10,wbDauO1SM6P4fBVEQBZTfQ,5,"Baiz Market is a ""Mediterranean"" type restaurant, or ""Arabic"" type food. Well, you could get confused and call it that. The fact of the matter is though, that this place has a very unique touch. This restaurant is a staple not only for groceries, but also its food. The owner is persian, so you can tell where the tastes are coming from. Its somewhat hidden in the heart of Phoenix, but that's ok, once you are there you will be glad you found it.This place is unique because they make their own bread! Are you kidding me? I only recently found out about this place like 3 years ago, and I've been living in Phoenix for 20 years. The chicken and beef shawarma have a special, authentic taste because of the fresh bread. One of the best parts about the shawarma is not only its amazing taste, but the pricing is very fair as well. I don't think I can stress this enough, but the fresh bread just sets this place apart from all the impostors in the Phoenix metro area. Why haven't the other restaurants caught on? I know of maybe one persian restaurant that makes their own bread, but their pricing makes them a different story (I'm talking about 'The Persian Room' in Scottsdale).I just don't understand how other restaurants can serve the bread that comes in plastic bags from a manufacturer hundreds of miles away. 'Good bread' and 'Arabic bread' are all good forms of pita that have great shelf life due to the ridiculous amounts of preservatives, but they just don't taste fresh.If you like the bread, head to the back of the store and there is a shelf of freshly baked pita bread, its baked throughout the day, I think. I can tell because sometimes my bread is still warm and the bag has a little condensation. Beware though, the bread gets hard and crunchy after a few days, so you really need to use it quickly. This isn't bad, its just I think they choose not to add preservatives to ensure the freshness of the pita.I usually just get the chicken or beef shawarma, but I decided I'd get a kabob plate one day because I also wanted hummus. The beef kabob plate came with hummus, bread, 2 skewers of beef kabob, and some pickles and onions. Wow. The beef kabobs were cooked perfectly, and were EXTREMELY tender. It was a tad bit on the lemony side, but I suppose that was necessary to make it so tender. Perhaps some of the best 'persian kabobs' I have ever had. The hummus was definitely good as well, I can't stand restaurants that crack open a can of premade hummus. This restaurant certainly did not disappoint with the hummus.I know friends in Tucson that make stops specifically at this place for shawarma, and rightly so. If you're weary of persian food, just check this place out. Its not expensive at all, food for two is like $15. The wide variety of ethnic foods is also interesting.",review,LHQ2fuC2RDS-Md_dN2O1IQ,0,0,0

He was the bartender as well, and still payed tons of attention to my table. He was very nice, and very helpful. He had extensive knowledge of the menu. He was also very personable. He laid out samples of their various barbeque sauces while giving some details about each one. He squirted them out onto an extra plate he brought to the table, and he made the shape of a smiley face with all the sauces. He made that dining experience so good that I wish I could write a review about him personally and suggest to his managers that he get a raise! I couldn't hear him when he stated his name over a large group that had just come in and was moving tables, but he was wonderful.  Also, one of the people with me is from the east coast, and likes vinegar-based barbeque sauce. They didn't have any of that kind in their current rotation of sauces, and he actually went back to the kitchen and explained the situation. A lady from the kitchen made a vinegar-based barbeque sauce from scratch just because one of us had mentioned how much we loved it.   I've never experienced service like that, and really can't say enough about how great this guy, and all other staff I came into contact with, was! Great job to whoever hired him.  The food was delicious, I love their fries! Unlike anything you can get anywhere else. I got the country roasted chicken- great seasoning, super moist and tender, while still having that chargrilled/roasted skin (my favorite).

He was so incredibly personable. He could have easily ignored us. I'm sure he's approached on a regular basis now that he's such a TV personality. But instead, he chatted us up and he talked about how he was so inspired by Asian food and how he wanted to bring that influence into his food and to Arizona. Before we knew it he was taking us in to see the latest renovations to Elements' kitchen! He proudly showed off the latest upgrades. Sure, there were new gadgets, but he even included skylights because his sous chefs said they hated never seeing the light of day. How cool is that?And to be revealed next month is an expansion to the kitchen that includes a table for 12 INSIDE the kitchen. Not a new concept for restaurants, but something Chef Macmillian is so excited about. There's no doubt that the food that he cranks out can be intimidating, but his latest endeavor speaks to his desire of having his guests witness the artistry behind the kitchen doors. This new addition promises to give you a full sensory experience BEFORE the plate even reaches your table -  from seeing, smelling and hearing what's happening in the kitchen to finally tasting the finished product.

Since I was in town visiting, it gave us the perfect excuse to go.I'm happy to report that the experience was most excellent at Great Wall and that it lived up to the hype.  Upon getting there, we were given a number to wait as the restaurant was completely full, there were probably 150+ people there dining, however, we were seated within 15 minutes.  As soon as we  sat down, the carts started rolling by with various plates of items to try.The pancake, shu mai, shrimp, duck, and sliced beef inside a wrapper are highly recommended, all were excellent.  I did have a bit of trouble taking the shrimp out of the steam container because their rice wrappers were sticking a bit, but that does happen.I would advise that if you have an allergy to shrimp that you make sure to ask the server what is in some of the items because they do come with shrimp, including their egg rolls.  Since my dad has a shrimp allergy we did have to watch for that.  I did want to try their egg rolls but I would have been the only one eating them, and they were big enough to make a meal in itself.The sliced duck was one of the best I have had at a restaurant, well cooked with crispy tasty skin, and not too many bones to get in the way, and very reasonably priced at $6.25 for a plate.  Most other Dim Sum plates are $2.25 or $3.15 so you can end up eating a lot for a very reasonable price.If you love Dim Sum and are willing to wait a few minutes for a table, but you will get fast service afterward, this really is the place you want to go to.

I came in looking to order food for takeout and get home to drown my sorrows in comfort food. i was directed by the hostess up front to go stand by the bakery and i would be able to order take out. i waited not 15 seconds and was greeted with a huge smile from a lovely girl named Danielle. She gave me a menu and told me to ask if i had questions and inquired if i had been there before. i looked at the menu for some time, unable to clear my mind enough to decide. She told me i was welcome to take a seat, and when i apologized for taking so long she responded with a smiley ""where's the fire? take your time, can i get you a glass of wine while you decide?"" wine was a perfect idea! I finally ordered and sat drinking my wine. i waited, and then waited a little longer, Danielle the young girl doing take out informed me the kitchen was working as fast as they could but are very busy, she apologized for the wait and offered complimentary bread  and convinced me to buy a a second glass of wine. When she brought me the second glass i had just gotten off the phone and was visibly shaken with more bad news. Somehow this young girl had the courage to ask if everything was alright and what she could do to help. It was just the olive branch i needed. Just the inquiry was enough to make me feel better. i told her i was fine and thanked her for her compassion. finally my food was ready. She boxed everything with care for the drive home. All this time smiling. i couldn't help but notice Danielle interact with the other employees they always laughed or high fived her with each exchange. She had brightened my day, and it was clear she is a light for others in Mimi's Cafe. This is the kicker...my bill was $30 and some change...i gave her what i thought was two $20 dollar bills, but in reality was a $50 and a $20. The young girl ran outside and stopped me saying sir, I'm not sure these bills are right. i was overwhelmed by her honesty and told her no, i thought they were two 20's but the difference would be her reward for honesty.

Well, Napoleon's closed forever, so I heard, but won't believe...) or dead. Citizen had a multi-course private affair they were finishing up. Kazimierz had some kind of themed jazz party going and was raucous and demanded a cover charge.

They do have a killer Moscow Mule which is served in a copper tankard to keep it cool. I've been coming in here, on average maybe once or twice a year since around 2007, and let me say at AZ88 the good things don't change. They still have a tantalizing food menu (they are a full boar upscale restaurant), and a drink menu that, together, rival anything else, really, in Lower Scottsdale (and in much of the Valley). Not to mention the atmosphere that for me has the perfect combination of sophistication, decor, music (4 more stars for the DJ's mellow-ambient rhythms) service, and vibe that indulges all the senses wonderfully.

tdeHd2AVYlEnz9F1UGb84Q,2/1/10,JruecU8cRBHYBNdsp-mMkw,5,"It's 1961 and we're having lunch in the courtyard of our Miami Beach hotel. Parker House rolls, sweet and salty, an open-face meatloaf sandwich with mushroom gravy. There's a surf board and a tiki carving amidst the flowers. But wait - something's wrong!! There's no humidity! Those are imported mushrooms in my gravy! I work to orient myself in time and space and find, what a relief, that I'm actually in Cafe ZuZu in downtown Scottsdale and it's 2010. The Valley Ho Resort, which houses the Cafe, is such a wonderful period piece. It opened in 1956 and was renovated in 2005 by a very wise design team that left the mid-century architecture and spirit intact. Cafe ZuZu is at the far end of the lobby, and its charming patio is surrounded with flowers. The decor is late 50's. If you're as old as we are, you'll recognize it instantly. The menu consists of ""Flavorful American comfort food. Familiar favorites with a contemporary twist."" There are goodies like warm Maytag blue cheese fondue ($7.50), truffled grilled cheese ($9), beef stroganoff ($17), and (gross) tuna salad with cottage cheese which brings me back to my childhood a little too clearly. While waiting for our entrees, we received a basket of Parker House rolls. These are the nice squishy white bread treats that, if you can manage not to eat them all, make wonderful toys. You can mold them into sculptures, or shape them into little round beebees to shoot through your straw. My meatloaf sandwich ($11.25) was served on a thick piece of grilled white bread topped first with melty cheese, then the meatloaf, then the gravy. There was a mound of lumpless mashed potatoes alongside. They were so smooth Ken wondered if they were made from instant, but they tasted much too good for that. The portion was huge, I took half home (of course I knew I was going to have dessert). Ken had sauteed liver, beautifully prepared, atop a mound of kale that had been cooked with high quality bacon, sauced with a Madera reduction. He loved it. I surprised him by ordering a lemon meringue tart ($6) for us to share. There were several chocolate desserts that sounded good, but I had a vision of the mile high meringue toppings of my childhood. The tart had only modest swirls of meringue, but it had been made in such a way that it was creamy, as opposed to foamy, and it was really good.The lemon custard was the star. I remembered a gelatinous filling, but this was smooth and velvety, with just the right tart/sweet balance. The pastry was a cross between cookie and pie crust, and stood up well to the filling. This was not an inexpensive meal, but the portions are large and quality is excellent. Plus we had joined an organization called The Lunch Club, which every weekday, emails it's members a discount coupon for a restaurant in their specified zip code. So one of our entrees was free! (The discount coupons differ, some are 20% off the bill, others merely are for a free drink). But, to pay Cafe ZuZu the ultimate compliment - I'd come here and pay full price.",review,QiR2X306Yzd9fuJdKDhkGg,1,1,2

Mr. T is Japanese & I lived in Japan for @4 years, so take my word it's authentic.The mix of foods is not so strange if you're familiar with restaurants in Japan.

The interior is clean, plenty of seating, a small bar at one end, and a counter from which you place your order.  Never having been before, I ask the counter-person for a recommendation.  ""What's good?""  He suggests the Original Gyro, served with fries or a greek salad.  Sounds good, I'll take it with fries.  With drink, under $9.  A few moments later (actually, I saw three other tables get served, so it seemed like a longish wait), a ginormous gyro arrives, with a huge helping of fries.  The gyro was huge, overflowing with, umm, meat, gyro meat, I guess, white onions, diced tomatoes and cucumber sauce (Tzatziki, I think).  The meat was well cooked, artfully shaved, and tender.  The sauce was also very good.  The pita?  Warm, soft and tasty.  The fries? Crisp and golden brown, and piping hot, about 3-4 times the size of Mickie D's or about 1/2 a 'steak fry'.  I was very impressed with the quality of the food, the cleanliness of the dining area, and the presence of a bar.  Most folks were eating gyros, or good sized greek salads.  Other items on the menu include several different gyros, burgers, sandwiches, a decent selection of pasta dishes and all kinds of Greek and non-Greek appetizers.  I plan on coming back, perhaps before a foray into Sun Devil Liquors...",review,PzTP2RCSdBrZLbaxXgZ3kA,0,0,0

Worked out perfect though, arrived at just about 4pm to see a hand full of people waiting and the the restaurant didn't open till 5pm.  After a short debate we decided to stay, it helped that there was ample shade.  The wait while hot was not uncomfortable and for the most part, newbies and veterans honored each others arrival order.  40 seats is not much for a place that does this much business and it was surprising to learn that most waiting were from out of town.  I also learned that reservations are accepted on line for parties of 6 to 10 and only 3 reservations per night.  Reservations are usually 1 1/2 to 2 months out.  Luckily for us there was only one reserved table for 10 ahead of everyone.  5 o'clock rolled around and the loading procedure ran smooth as clock work and we had drink and food orders in by quarter after.  Service was excellent and fast with just the right amount of time between salad and main course.  I could not have asked for much more from my food, maybe a bit more basil on my mozzarella and tomato salad, everything was amazing including my Mexican coke.  We ordered 2 pizzas, both wood fire baked to perfection.  I could have eaten a whole loaf of the bread that comes with the salads, or for $2 on its own.  None of our food was greasy or soggy, the olive oil they use is excellent and the fresh mozzarella mouth watering.  I will go back again, planning on getting there an hour before opening.

We were enjoying a few Left Hands and ordered the Tuesday night pizza special. It was 2 for 1 basically so we each ordered our fave. Apparently the GM thought my pizza was too done so he brought out the "" burnt"" one and already had another one cooking. I actually like my pizza that way but hey, I could understand where he was coming from. The second pizza was beautiful, a work of art. My husband's pie was great, all he kept saying was how great the crust was. I wil definitely bring all my friends and clients here.

bgTB6MgdVQssXhkNJ7qIfw,7/8/09,CMkjJvIAhiFVHOAv85LUvQ,5,"Roka Akor has a classy atmosphere, and a slightly formidable menu to pick from. Everything looks so good, and in a new environment, I want to try it all! But my date and I, after much deliberation, decided to ""go for broke"", as it were and if we couldn't finish, at least we had a good sample of the menu.  For an appetizer, we got the butterfish tataki and the burnt red tomato salad. These were yummy little tidbits that disappeared off the plate quickly. The butterfish was delicate, and the salad was great - the greens had all sorts of different flavors, and not that ""generic clump of lettuce"" flavor I hate. From the sushi menu, I was feeling adventurous and had never had raw red meat before, so I ordered the wagyu gunkan. My date saw the amount of green onions piled on top of this dish and oh-so-chivalrously gave me his piece. It's true that you needed a healthy appreciation of green onion to like these as served. The wagyu beef is ground nearly to a puree - which I wasn't expecting, and I thought the onion was a bit much. At for the skewers we ordered, my date liked his sweet potatoes the best, but I was partial to the crispy BBQ. These turned out to be two large ovoid and solid shapes of rice, run through with a skewer. Pure white sushi rice in the center, the outside was caramelized with what tasted like the sweet BBQ sauce that comes on eel sushi, which gave the whole thing a nice, crispy shell. At this point, I got to what I consider to be the crowning achievement of the meal: the yuzu marinated black cod. The cod, cooked on the robata grill in a leaf, was meltingly soft and delicately flavored. It was an effort to be share fairly. I believe my date said after our first taste of it, ""Just eat what you want and I'll finish ..."",  I looked up from my chopsticks, ""... you know what? Just cut me off half."" I wasn't sure that I could handle dessert after eating so much, but we finally decided it wouldn't be fair not to give the dessert menu a looking over, right? So we ordered the baked green tea custard, and it was a perfect pick after a gut-busting meal. Light and airy, it also had some carbonation to it that tickled my taste buds and made me giggle a lot as I was eating it.  Our sampler of shochu ranged from impressive to harsh, at least to my taste buds. In order starting with least harsh: pineapple, honeycomb, raspberry, and apple. I didn't like the last two, but the pineapple was, in my mind, a fairly dangerous thing to drink when you're not paying attention. Smooth. That's it for the food, and as for the service, it was swift and considerate; glasses were kept full, and empty plates whisked away. There was, however, one glaring exception that nearly overpowered the entire evening with its oddness. The waiter, who had up till this point been very nice and chatty, helpful about menu items, and generally a pretty cool guy, handed me his phone number and told us to call him any time we wanted to go partying.  What am I supposed to do with this? Are we going to call our waiter up and say ... well, what? It flummoxed me.",review,aEZarRBZY7qEMNKk5nePxA,1,2,2

This place was more than accommodating. The waitress was fantastic, even though we were a pain in the butt come check time. I took her suggestions for our family style dinner and not one disappointed. I highly recommend the Rigatoni D and Chicken Prosciutto. Both were fantastic entrees. To top it off, we finished out with killer tiramisu. There is nothing bad I can say for this place. The atmosphere is what you would  expect from a large italian restaurant.

They offer a refreshing alternative for hotel restaurants, with lively ambiance and great food and drink.Gallo Blanco's tacos are surefire hits. They're served individually, and come lined up in an appealing silver taco stand. We've ordered the carne asada and shrimp soft tacos, and, wow, they're really mouthwatering. The shrimp is flame grilled and seared, bringing out a nice full flavor. The guacamole is slightly sweet and chunky, and paired with outstanding tortilla chips, this is a must-order appetizer. Even the sauces (I prefer the red chipotle one) are addictive, either to accompany the supreme tacos, or to be enjoyed alone on chips.This restaurant is a fine addition to the emerging downtown Phoenix foodie scene, and with prices extremely reasonable, you get a lot. A good sized meal for two (sans drinks) could ring up at $30-35, which is a good value for great food. Try Gallo Blanco, bring friends, and get a bunch of items.

I always assumed it was more of a pub than a restaurant.  My wife and I arrived around 5:00pm and were seated immediately.  The waiter was super attentive and knew the menu and preparation of everything I asked about.  We started with an AMAZING appetizer special of burrata* with ciabatta tips, their house spicy tomato jam and arugula with champagne vinaigrette.  It was described as a sort of an experimental combination of preparations from other dishes.  The burrata was silky smooth and spreads onto the ciabatta like softened cream cheese.  The play of flavors in this dish was excellent, we'd go back here just for this dish alone.My wife ordered the lobster bisque as her entree, which was smooth and creamy with a good lobster flavor.  I suspect we could have asked for bread on the side, but it didn't come with it by default.I ordered the short ribs with roasted asparagus and jalapeno cheddar grits.  The ribs were cooked just right, just a little pink and tender with a concentrated glaze of delicious sauce layered on top.  The sauce had a light smoky flavor with a fair amount of saltiness, and appeared to be a long simmered reduction with bold flavor. As others have mentioned, the jalapeno grits are very good, not spicy by any means but a little crunch from the jalapeno pieces, creamy and well prepared.  I strongly recommend the short ribs to anyone.We splurged with dessert of key lime pie and a banana split.  The split included three large scoops of (what appeared to be) homemade ice cream and topped with caramelized pecans.  The key lime was tart and delicious.The portion sizes were perfect and considering the careful preparation and unique flavors the price was appropriate.  It's a little more expensive that I would like to put Grassroots into our weekly rotation, but I look forward to visiting it again and sample more items off the menu when the budget allows.* I didn't know what burrata was: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Burrata",review,Esi0LF6paDqj7W0LcDX4AA,1,1,0

No, it's not an extremely enlightened idea. I've been sneaking Bacardi into theaters since 2003 so it's about time theaters realize they should probably attempt to turn a profit off of it, but AMC really upped the game by not only providing me the option of purchasing alcoholic beverages from THEM, but also upgraded chairs, and a ton of delicious food (Including the obligatory $4 box of candy which is hilarious sitting next to a $9 burger.

Almost double for the nice seats. But trust me, YOU WANT THOSE SEATS.

There is no adequate excuse , but anyway, my third adventure here made me update my review to 5 stars because 5th and Wine has earned it.The wines by the glass range from $8 - $11 unless you come in before 6pm then they are only $5! Those prices alone should make you want to come here for drinks with friends. The servers have always been cool with offering samples if you can't make up your own mind between two wines despite the recommendation from the server and your friend saying ""just pick one!"". Due to this fact, I've always had a glass that I have enjoyed, which is usually a Zinfandel. I have now had the pleasure of experiencing all of their different types of bruschetta. My top two favorites are the Prosciutto, Mascarpone, Figs, and Tomato Jam which has a great combination of salty and sweet, and the Apples, Brie, and Fig Jam one which is on the sweeter side, but not overwhelming because the bread and the tart granny smith apple slices help balance out the flavor. The Chopped Salad is very light and refreshing option to accompany the brushcetta appetizer. 5th and Wine is also a restaurant so other food options are available, I have sampled the Chicken and Pesto Pasta which has a delicious cream sauce and their Mac & Cheese which is super rich with the two types of melted cheese, but both items are delicious.The atmosphere is great whether you are sitting inside or outside. The lighting is soft, giving more of an intimate feel, yet this place still remains simple and casual, which I love. The outside patio is great, it is a courtyard that offers peeks into store windows while remaining private from the traffic of Old Town. The times I have been here it has never been super crowded and I am able to just walk in and be seated right away. 5th and Wine still feels like a hidden gem and you must try it out!",review,fl6oI21uXoxVMwfR6lFanQ,0,0,0

#NAME?,4/25/11,dcWNhMfe67XhUPeeBTzJFQ,5,"Had a fabulous time here with my husband celebrating my birthday last weekend. We both got ""The Farmer's Feast"" and it was truly amazing. I was not expecting that we would each get unique dishes so that let us sample even more of the food (though the hubby didn't really share too much). I highly recommend this option for anyone dining here. The antipasti was a great selection of cured meats and local cheeses. Next, I had a wonderful salad that was a great combination of sharp peppery flavors mixed with sweet. Strawberries, arugula, radishes, yum! For pasta course I got gnocchi with a rich and tasty cream sauce and my husband got ravioli stuffed with yam. His dish was amazing, I had to fight for a couple bites. For the fish course I had poached halibut that was served with some kind of really flavorful sauce and a vegetable puree so that whole thing was extremely delicious. The hubby got a very lightly seared tuna fillet. I was very surprised that he enjoyed it so much since he is usually not a raw fish kind of guy. For our main course I got a pork tenderloin and the hubby got braised beef... just lucky we each got our favorite meats. Each came with other vegetables and starches on the plate so they would have been an ample meal in and of themselves. For dessert, I got a goat cheese cheesecake that was truly amazing. One of the best deserts I have ever eaten. Very rich but the pieces were small enough so that it was not heavy. The dessert did not have too much sweetness so it went well with the ice wine it was served with which tasted like pure honey. Just fantastic. The hubby got bread pudding which we didn't much care for and it came with a sorbet that I didn't try. I got the wine pairings with the meal and every wine just complimented the dish it was served with so beautifully that I was really glad I added that option. Also, it ended up that you got a half glass (at least) with each course so I think it is a good value (the wine pairing was an extra $45.) I do agree with a couple of the reviewers who mentioned salt. There were a couple of dishes that had just a tad too much. However, I think that was not due to a mistake of the chef, I believe it is just because they use cured meats in a lot of their dishes. Another reviewer mentioned bad service but we did not experience that at all. Our server was extremely warm and friendly. She was very knowledgeable on the food and could answer any questions we had for her. She also took the time for each course to explain each dish and in my case the wine and why they went together. Only one time did my wine not come out at the same time with the food course and in that case our server apologized immediately. I do agree with some of the reviewers that the service is very slow... however, I believe that this is intentional. They have created a very cozy and comfortable environment and they want you to linger and enjoy yourself. With the Farmer's Feast in particular it took us almost 3 hours start to finish but I enjoyed every minute of it. It was nice to have time in between courses to sit and talk and relax. The spacing also kept us from feeling too full by the end (it is six courses after all!) or from letting the flavors from one dish influence the next. I was able to enjoy each course separately and independently with its own unique wine. It was pure food heaven. This is not the type of place where you would stop in for a meal before a show or event; when you come here, this should be your only destination for the night and it is such a great experience that it will be enough!  We truly had fantastic night here.One warning I will say is for ladies, you need to be prepared for the rural atmosphere and the walk from the car to the restaurant would be challenging in heels (I had been warned so had wedges). In fact the dress code overall was a bit more casual than I was expecting. Kai at Wildhorse Pass resort is my absolute favorite ""special occasion"" restaurant and so we were making a lot of comparisons between the two. My husband made the comment that when we were at Kai we spoke in library whispers the whole time and felt a little awkward at times (you know the type of place where you feel like if you use the wrong fork you may end up getting kicked out) but at Quiessence we were chatting away the whole time and completely at ease. It is definitely a much more comfortable and relaxed environment then any other I have experienced at a restaurant of this caliber.",review,VPXgY9lGJF3XC4ZpusxNuA,0,2,1

The food is very reasonably priced which make it easy to try a variety of dishes. We started with the shorba which is a lentil based soup. This was probably my favorite part of the meal, it was absolutely delicious---satisfying and hearty. We also had the vegetable combination which had 5 different dishes served on the injera, a crepe-like bread you eat the main dishes with.This is a fun way to eat (with your hands) and opened up a new world of foods for us! Can't wait to go back and devour a bowl of shorba.",review,sPEFql7fLp0oouFxnooGpQ,1,3,0

Elegant but comfortable atmosphere, reasonable prices, and a real enthusiasm from the staff (and a chef, who came to visit with folks that he knew who were sitting near us).

The main I had today was their Mardi Gras Pasta, which is linguini with tomato, thin-sliced garlic, andouille sausage, crawfish meat, onion and delicious shrimp topped with a really nice creamy sauce. Absolutely delicious. The wife had mahi-mahi with an even NICER sauce, and dirty rice on the side. Although a tiny bit on the pricy side it's definitely worth coming back to. Large open seating (outdoor seating also available), dimly lit, old-style jazz, a large full-service bar and a very quaint outside waiting area with water feature, giant fans etc. The service was also great and both times I've been, the waiters have been very helpful (the first guy told me that if I got the large serving of alligator, to try it 'half-blackened' - a great tip which allowed me to taste both 'styles' of the appetizer).

We have been there many times, but we felt we needed to share our experience.  We enjoyed sitting at the bar having a few drinks and visiting other patrons. Around 9:50 we realized the kitchen would be closing. I asked Daniel and Baeley the bartenders what time the kitchen served ""dinners"" of course he stated 10:00pm ""OOPS"". But Daniel said they would prepare what ever we wanted.  I asked him to check to see if they have already started to clean up first. We do not like to ask the kitchen staff to prepare dinner if they had already began or completed clean up. Daniel returned to say that yes they had finished the grill, but he again repeated that they would still prepare anything we wanted. At that time we declined to have the kitchen staff prepare anything. But a moment later, Roman the chef came up to us and sincerely stated that he would be more than pleased to prepare whatever we wanted. Still we were not wanting to make such a request  that late, but with his sincere and friendly personality he still insisted that they were more than willing.  So we asked him to pick  and prepare something of his choice which turned out to be the best two burgers that we have enjoyed in a long time, a Bacon Cheese Burger and his speciality Texan Jalapeno  Burger both with extra crispy bacon just the way we like it. SOOOOO....we would highly recommend Blue 32 and it's staff including by name, Roman the chef and Daniel and Baeley the bartenders.

We made our reservations well in advance. Having gone to a few spa resorts, I couldn't wait to pay this one a visit. My cousin and I were each booked for the Little Yellow Bird spa package, which was comprised of 2 services each. We arrived about 15 minutes prior to our appointment time and was given a tour of the spa. After changing in the women's locker room, and relaxing in the private women's lounge area (there's a large lounge area, but it's co-ed), our masseuses met us and brought us into our room. My cousin and I decided for our first service to be the Companion Massage. After only having solo massages, I was interested how a companion massage differed. The 50 minute Aji Massage flew by. My masseuse was professional and the massage given was very comfortable, relaxing and beneficial. After our massages were completed, we had some time in between our next service, feeling a little hungry, we decided to grab some lunch from the spa's cafe. I ordered the flatbread pizza and it was TO DIE FOR! Seeded flatbread topped off with a garlic peppery aioli, grilled chicken pieces, pesto sauce, marinated bell peppers, melted cheese and avocado. My visit was a month and a half ago and my memory, a little fuzzy, but that was one of the best lunches I've had in a long time!! After lunch sometime, we each were up for our second service, our facials!!! Due to my skin type, I received the Aji Rain Facial. My esthetician was wonderful! Her hands were soft and gentle while working on my face and we had some lovely conversation during the 50 minute procedure. I left that room with my face feeling renewed, clean and fresh!All spa treatments include full use of the spa's facilities so we definitely made well use of that! After our facials, we used the sauna (the steam room was out of service during our visit) and whirlpools located on the women's locker side. We then relaxed and lounged by the outside pool. The Aji Spa is such a calm, warm and relaxing environment that I ended up taking a nap! Outside! In desert heat! Thank goodness for the wooden awning with misters attached and the huge patio umbrellas providing shade! The staff at the spa provided excellent service! From the front desk, to our masseuse, the esthetician, the cafe staff and the locker room attendant! While napping, one of the staff from the cafe even brought us iced water with lemon and cucumber slices in it!Our appointment started at 12pm and with our 2 procedures, and lunch, we should have been done and out of there within a few hours. But the point of visiting the spa was to relax, and with Aji Spa being such a lovely place, we just didn't want to leave!  We finally left nearly 8 hours after our arrival, and we would have stayed longer if we could! I highly recommend Aji Spa to anyone visiting the Phoenix area, or if you're looking for a new spa to travel to! Aji Spa is a beautiful spa with excellent staff and service. They even emailed me the same day of my service as a ""Thank You"" for visiting and included a discount coupon on my next visit!

I grew up eating great po-boys, gumbo, red beans, and wouldn't consider eating any of these if not well prepared. That said, I can truly say that Jennifer and the Flavors of Louisiana gang make cajun food as good as any you'll find in New Orleans--SERIOUSLY. The po-boys are spot on (though the bread could be a little crustier) and the chicken & andouille gumbo is even better than mine--and, I assure you, that's DAMN GOOD. Frankly, I've never had better. The only thing that is not ""as good as it gets"" is the red beans and rice. They're good, but not quite the creamy ""Washday Monday"" staple that I grew up on. My cajun grandmother has Jennifer beat on that one, but not by much. But, if you want a special treat and want to taste something that kills all, get a sausage po-boy. Hot sausage or smoked sausage po-boys are a New Orleans staple and my favorite po-boys of all. But, Jennifer blows them all away with her home-made andouille. Simply put, I've never had better sausage--ever. It's the reason her gumbo is soooo good and her po-boy the best ever.I've eaten at Flavors many times, even though I live across town. Every time I go, I eat like a pig and bring some home to eat later. I have no affiliation with the restaurant, but wanted to post this as a review from someone who really knows New Orleans food and as a thank you to Jennifer and her crew for giving me a source for the best flavors in the World (not just Louisiana). As a matter of fact, I even overlook the fact that Jennifer is from Baton Rouge, instead of New Orleans or Lafayette and for not having any USL/UL Lafayette paraphernalia on the LSU/Saints wall. At least that is, so long as she keeps her promise to open another restaurant on the east side of town--that is, a lot closer to where I live.If you want the ONLY good cajun food in Phoenix, treat yourself to Flavors of Louisiana.

This pizza is a delicious combination of organic olive oil and garlic, Fontina and mozzarella cheeses, mushrooms, tomatoes, goat cheese, Kalamata olives, and basil. Melts right in your mouth and one can easy eat more than one expected! If even after all of this you still crave something sweet - One cannot go wrong with electing their ""Classic Chocolate Chip Skillet Cookie"" ($7.00).  This sinful combination includes two scoops of organic vanilla bean or coconut vanilla ice cream served with your choice of organic chocolate, chocolate mint, or chocolate raspberry sauce over a fresh-baked chocolate chip cookie.  Oh wondrous dessert indeed!Picazzo's will leave you most satisfied and delighted with all that is good.  With the finest ingredients, Picazzo's takes great care in delivering the best in atmosphere and dish.

This place came up on Yelp and looked interesting so we figured we would give it a try.  The food was pretty good.  My son had a cheese crisp, wife had beef enchiladas and a chicken taco, Mother-in-law had pork tamales, and I had the beef green chile.  They gave us to big baskets of chips and salsa (which we eat too much of!).  Everything was pretty good, but the margaritas were really good.  I always try the house first time I go someplace since I think it is a good judge of how good a place is and theirs did not disappoint.

We are self-professed foodies, good cooks, etc.Let's start with the fact that they seated us promptly at our reservation time, and that reservation had only been made that day.....surprising, because the place was packed!! Alfonso was our waiter, and he was awesome and didn't hesitate to make suggestions that we were happy to add to our dinner. First, the margaritas. ....this place knows how to pour, and they are fresh  - the only way we will drink them. Next - there are only 3 places in Phoenix that can make good table-side guacamole, and this is the best of them. Alfonso suggested a fried pork belly/cola reduction appetizer that I had to be talked into. OMG....heaven, and such a complex blend of flavors that the sweet, crunchiness of the pork belly can only be described as ""worth it"" if you are balking at the issue of pork belly.Entree: we chose the Chorizo Porchetta and the Scallops. Both were excellent and may I say that the timing of each course was unbelievably prompt. We never waited and yet didn't feel rushed.Dessert: I confess that I read the dessert menu first before making dinner decisions, and while other reviews loved the selections ...I wasn't blown away. The churros were small and dough-y, and the milkshake was just to heavy/sweet after a meal.....better to fill the churros with a cheese and serve them warm on dulce de leche ice cream. Fried bananas didn't excite me either. Bananas are bananas..... The pumpkin bread pudding seemed heavy and Autumn-like for a 110 degree day in Arizona and did not compliment the Latin flavors of the dinner. I feel their dessert menu needs to be expanded in a way that compliments their cuisine....some citrus sorbet, chocolate-with-red-chile cake, lime cheesecake.

It's right by downtown Phoenix, and in fact right next to a Light Rail stop--so keep this in mind, parking is metered and sometimes hard to come by easily, if you live by a light rail this may be the smarter option.  The place is seriously tiny, only about 6-8 groups of people can be seated at one time.  A slight drawback is that there is limited outdoor seating, which, given the predictably large lines even on weekdays, is a problem.  The Phoenix sun will make a 45 minute wait seem like an hour and a half wait.Now about the service.  I've always had a good experience with the people who work here.  The first time I came here, apparently one of the owners saw that I looked lost, because she came out and very kindly explained how people are seated, where I can go to get coffee in the meantime.  She even suggested I leave my cell phone number and she'll call me when my seat is ready, in case I'm shopping for example.  The waitresses always serve us quickly and never leave us hanging, and they're always smiling, which for some reason makes the experience so much better.Now for the best part.  I swear, they put crack in their food, because although their breakfast options are simple, they are out of this world.  The first time I came here I got the waffles.  Perhaps it's because they use REAL maple syrup, or all of the ingredients are organic and locally grown, but they make the best waffles I've ever had.  I don't even know how one makes a good waffle really, it seems pretty formulaic, but it's stellar.  I ordered it with bacon, which was also wonderful--the bacon used was the good stuff, not the excessively fatty bacon you buy at the supermarket.  Every bite is spectacular, and when you're done, you're full, but not the kind of full you'll often get at breakfast joints where you think you're going to explode or take a nap--full, but refreshed.The second time I came I got the pancakes.  Not the best pancake I've ever had, but still, superb and the real maple syrup just sends it through the roof.  The third time I went I got the waffle again (see above).Before I came here, I was excited about leaving Phoenix for New York due to the incredible array of dining options you get in that city.

I met up with the fabulous Jennifer T. and I was so happy to check this place out!I like any place that I get to walk in through a back door. I passed through the very chill looking patio area first, another plus in my book. Plenty of outdoor seating that looked dangerously inviting once this hot hot heat cools off. Inside was intimate, but with the large windows, it wasn't dark and depressing. Like your own little happy wine bar world.They have an amazing wood burning oven. Normally, that itself is plenty good enough, but then there's the food that comes out of that wonderful oven. I only tried the spinach and artichoke dip, which was the best I have ever had! It didn't have a pool of oil (first time for everything!), it was so fresh, and I really appreciated seeing the bread sliced fresh right in front of us, since we were sitting at the bar. I saw several other things (flatbread)  come out of that oven, and I will have to go back to try them! Everything smelled delicious and was presented with a touch of class without being pretentious. I was also very intrigued by the eggplant dip which is apparently ""better than baba!"" Now for the drinks. Holy cow. I've been drinking a few years now, so safe to say, I've tried many, many drinks. Or so I thought. Coconut mojito anyone!? Made with Ciroc Coconut vodka!  As tasty as mojitos are, I don't get a long well with rum, so vodka was a pleasant surprise, and the coconut just brought the mmmmmazing factor to a whole new level. I also tried the white sangria, another 5 stars. Great wine list too- Apothic Red is one of a few reds I like, and they have it!  The staff was top notch as well. I arrived shortly before a shift change, and both bartenders were personable and hard working, and truly seemed to enjoy what they were doing. I'm pretty bad with names unfortunately, or I would love to mention them.I can't wait to go back! For drinks and food!

They also serve Barq's Red Cream soda from tap, which is impossible to find anywhere in the southwest.

The cold smoked duck was sooo delish as was the special mountain leafy green with bean curd shreds (all minced fine and not on the regular menu). There was also a shredded pork dish with bamboo (excellent) and a pickled vegetable with fish soup. The soup wasn't really my thing because it was heavily seasoned with white pepper which I hate but the rest of my family said it was exceptional.Our second visit was for lunch before heading off to the airport for the return trip. I could have eaten the entire scallion pancake myself as well as the cold spicy pork belly dish. Luckily, we ordered two orders of fried potstickers because those were delicious as well.

Outside they have picnic tables, horseshoes, and fire pits (gets chilly out there in the desert!), and on the weekends they have live music and dancing. Inside, the bar is pretty small, and the place is covered in dollar bills and business cards left by satisfied cowboys and cowgals. For the nights without live music, don't you fret, they have a jukebox with tons of country hits.

For non-Indians, they should be informed that this is a Dosa house so order dosa and other south Indian dishes.  Don't order your typical Indian restaurant favorites like palak paneer (it wasn't good here).   The owner also says every dish is excellent which isn't true; he is kind of a businessman so he doesn't really care about telling you which dishes stand out.

We ventured downstairs to look at the bar, and had we been there early enough to snag a couch I wouldn't have wanted to leave.It definitely feels like a splurge, or somewhere you'd take a business associate or date that you wanted to wow.

When they ask you if you want hot sauce, say 'si' and drizzle it mightily onto the tacos. Piled cheese, beef, lettuce, tomatoes all stuffed into an authentic-style taco shell - it doesn't get any better than this. Just make sure you put a helmet on because it's crazy good.If you like spicy, no-nonsense burritos, go with the Carne Asada Burrito (Red Chile).If you like the whole meal, go with the Carne Asada or Pollo Asado burrito combo plates.

Nope.While Senor Taco is technically 'fast food' it does take some time to prepare. If you do drive-thru don't get all road ragey if it takes longer than it does at Taco Bell. There is a price to pay to make good food and that price is TIME. This is not a worldwide chain that spends more on advertising and earning your business by putting cute little dogs on plastic mugs. Senor Taco is not that type of place. A little wait is very much worth it.I realize that appearance of the location irks some reviewers. Yes, it is in a strip mall. Yes it is 100-150 feet away from a gas station slash AM/PM mini market. I get that. But this is not Sanctuary. This is not Kai. This is not Deseo. When one reviewer (and I use the word 'reviewer' loosely here) hilariously claims to have walked in, used his Superman vision to supposedly spot a family of offending microbes and (without trying the food) proceeded to sprint out because he was frightened of all the imagined cooties ... well... I just have to laugh. That's not a review, it's a drive-by, and reviewers like this are probably happier with Hometown Buffet or Luby's Cafeteria. And that's too bad because this is excellent fast food.I've eaten here maybe 15-20 times and my wife has ordered the fish taco plate a number of times and neither of us has ever gotten sick.

The calamari was decent, could have been spiced up a bit or served with something more than marinara sauce, but for those who don't like a lot of fan fare with their food, this would be perfect; classic calamari with classic sauce.  We loved the Stella Artois draft beer and martinis came out big and filled to the brim, just how I like them.  For our entrees we ordered the Baked Ziti and Sausage and the Rigatoni ""D"".  Both of them were absolutely fantastic...yumm.  And both were HUGE.  The baked ziti stayed warm right up until we packed the rest to take home because they actually bake it right in the ceramic type dish that they serve it in, very smart.  For those with little ones, the kids menu is awesome and probably the healthiest meal a kid is going to get anywhere.  Nothing at this place is pre packaged or pre made and that goes for the kids meals as well.  Their chicken fingers are home made (the pickiest of adults would eat these things!), no french fries; home made mashed potatoes and broccoli florets.  This is the KIDS menu!  Our waiter needed to be coaxed out of his shell, but he was still warm in that great way that the good ones know how to do without intruding.  Great leather booths, linen napkins, white table cloths with a white and red checkered one thrown on top for added warmth, elegant, but not stuffy.  Guys could go in with t-shirts and dress shorts and fit right in and for the ladies who like to dress up, you can as well with out feeling overly so.I am definitely going here again, what a find!",review,iNplaNMe_XisdyWcaT2Rvg,2,5,1

Even my Bloody Mary had a slice of crisp bacon in it along with a celery spear, olives and onions. Probably one of the best Bloody Mary's I have had in awhile. The location is a little off the beaten path which is why, I think, people are lined up to get in the Breakfast Club a couple of blocks away for mediocre food, and here at Bacon- the food and service is better and there was no line on the Sunday I was there. I was seated in what they call ""the nook"" located on the side where I had full view of the restaurant. The menu was well organized and entrees come with toast and breakfast potatoes and your choice of a side of bacon or ham. You can also substitute fresh tomatoes if that is your wish. The food came up quickly and was delicious! My ham and cheese omelet was perfectly done (all melted cheese and ham inside and firm eggs on the outside) and the side of bacon was crisp and tasty. Given the size, this easily was a 4 egg omelet. Breakfast with drinks ran about $20 which was cheap for all the food I got. But I would be remiss if I didn't talk about what really blew me away about this place. It's the fantastic service! Everyone seems to be part of a larger team. I was greeted by one person, seated by another and had at least three servers taking care of me. And countless people stopped by to ask how things were, if I needed more water for my tea, or if I wanted more preserves for my toast. It was unbelievable! While they have been open for 9 months- they had the staff of a place that has been open much longer. The ambiance is contemporary but is warmed up by the blue booths, checkered table cloths, and some mismatched dining tables in the center that can be expanded for larger groups. There are also antique food cases lining the walls filled with tins of chocolate, and other food ""cues"". I also liked that they have those ""roll up"" doors on the one side that bring the outdoors in and seats outside on those perfect days. If I lived in Scottsdale- this would be my ""go to"" brunch place. What I don't get is why people are waiting in line at a place around the corner that left me a little cold. C'mon people. If you haven't checked Bacon out- you should. After all- what's not to like about, Bacon?",review,68Ci9UgVIVEiCGXy05loLw,2,3,2

Last Friday, me and my 2 brothers left the suns game, and proceed to put a few ""adult"" beverages back. At around 2am, when Haney's shut down, we had an overwhelming craving for crap pizza (its better than our normal Jack in Box at 3am run that usually ends up with someone puking in the drive thru line because the smell of the taco sauce is so amazing). Low and behold, the ONLY spot that was still taking orders (up to 2am!) was D'moes. Now, 1st off - I live at Summitt (by BOB). These guys gladly delivered to me, all the way down there! Major props for that. 2 - They understood me... considering I don't remember ordering the pizza (I woke up to pizza and wings boxes all over my pad, and me saying ""who ordered pizza"" then I burped... wing sauce and vodka is a healthy combo. 3 - apparently, after checking my voice mail, the driver was pounding on our door for about 5 minutes (we were REALLY jamming out to Rock Band, in case you don't know, were pretty awesome. Wikipedia that Ish ladies and Gent's; Kansas City Bullriders). Well, the driver and my door man both called 3 times. I'm assuming the driver eventually came in and grabbed the bass guitar and strummed it out. Maybe he had a slice with us? Who really knows these things. However, I do know that I was insanely impressed with D'moes... from the left overs I ate the next when I could remember. It was pretty darn good. Between the awesome'ness that is called ""their customer service"" and the legit taste it left in my mouth, I'm a believer, unless, if I say I'm not, will I get a commercial?... hmmmm....

This is a brand new bar located right next to Seamus, within the San Carlos through an agreement with the hotel's ownership. For years, I've thought the Hotel San Carlos was an under-appreciated (through its own fault) downtown venue. With the Ghost, the owner has finally executed a plan to revive its rightful place on the downtown Phoenix scene. This is apparent from the first step inside the lobby, which appears as it did in 1928 when the hotel first opened. If celebrities in the 1930s had to spend the night in Phoenix, back then a small, un-airconditioned cowboy town with around 50,000, they would have stayed here. (Or else the near-by Westward Ho). You get a taste of those times with the massive photographic blow-ups the Ghost has put up on its walls of various scenes from early 20th century downtown Phoenix. So large that you can zero in on individual pedestrians on the streets, and marvel at their bowties, cowboy hats, handkerchiefs and facial expressions. Back then, the San Carlos was probably one of the only places in town that was ""air-cooled."" (That may have meant it had swamp coolers. I haven't googled the history of air conditioning technology for this review.)I'd describe the bar's style as grandiose, and classic old school Phoenix with an obligatory hint of Chicago (obligatory given the decades-old economic relationship betweeen the two cities that endures to this day).

First I like the layout of this place, very open and airy. There are 2 outside patios one street level and then one upstairs. I actually have been here twice so far. First time was just for a mid afternoon cocktail with one of my stylists. The servers were very friendly and our concoction of vodka, grapefruit and cranberry juice was the perfect blend. The second time we ordered 3 small plates to share, ahi tacos, artichoke and spinach dip and the mussels. All three were heavenly and very reasonably priced. The ahi was fresh and chilled, perfect for a warm day. The artichoke dip was different than any I have had before, gooey cheesy goodness that we gobbled up practically licking the bowl. The chips that accompanied the did were fresh and perfectly salted, even when the dip was done we still polished off the chips. The mussels were in a perfect white wine sauce but the stars of this dish were the mussels themselves. Buttery and melt in your mouth good, not chewy at all with no grit, to most common problem I find. The broth was so good I let the bread marinate at the bottom of the bowl, soaking up the juice. My martini was a generous pour and even though they were out of blue cheese stuff olives the bartender took the time to stuff some and deliver it to our table. Now on to the staff, all are a good looking lot but they are also skilled. All of our food and drinks were delivered in a timely manner by our lovely server Jennifer. We also met one of the sous chefs, Lennie. A charming fellow with stunning blue eyes, my grandmother remarked on them, a playful Mohawk and tattoos peaking out of his uniform. He swears that the sweet potato fries are some of the best in town and sent over a complimentary bucket. I do believe he is right, cooked to perfection, slightly crisp on the outside, warm and soft on the inside dusted with fresh herbs and I believe Parmesan cheese. After our meal the manager came over to make sure everything was to our liking. RnR is another great place within walking distance from my salon and I am looking forward to trying everything on their menu.

#NAME?,1/16/09,DVW0IWm4wzRJ30kcWIivqQ,5,"This is one excellent Ethiopian restaurant, rivals anything I've sampled in Washington DC or Seattle.  If I lived in Phoenix, this would be a Top-5 restaurant for me (along with Lo-Lo's Chicken & Waffles - yum!).Lalibela takes a slightly different approach to their menu.  Many of the entrees are offered as small portions ($4.50-$6.00 each).  They suggest each diner order 2-3 of these to make a meal. Kitfo and Lamb Tibs dishes are offered as full entrees and like many Ethiopian restaurants, you can order combo plates (meat combo, veggie combo, house combo plate etc.).  This made deciding on our meal a little more complicated, but also offered more flexibility for sampling different dishes.Our favorite dish ordered was the Lamb Tibs (the spicy version with Awaze spice paste).  Lamb was soooo tender, and the spices were a delight - rich in flavor but not too hot for those with tame palettes.  Good thing it comes as a full order - four of us were competing for bites!!  We ordered a half portion of Keye Wott (beef in a spicy brown sauce) that was some of the best I've ever had.  Again, rich in flavor but not too spicy.  My favorite Ethiopian meat dish is Kitfo - choice beef sort of like steak tartar (servered raw or lightly cooked) but with Ethiopian spices.  Lalibela's was pretty good, just not transcendent like the Lamb Tibs or Beef Keye Wott.  The vegetable dishes were on a whole excellent - especially the yellow lentils, gomen (collard greens) and spicy (Wott) lentils.Staff was great - attentive, helpful service.  Unlike some Ethiopian restaurants, this one is very user-friendly.  Although in some cases  the menu accommodates American tastes it doesn't compromise on quality or authenticity.  One note on the injera (sponge-like bread used to scoop up the entrees) - it's a mix of wheat flour and teff (a grain indigenous to Ethiopia) and I don't think it's fermented like injera that is made with 100% teff.  I'm used to the latter, but you can argue Lalibela's injera doesn't compete with the flavor of the entrees as much.All in all, one of the best Ethiopian restaurants I've been to, and I have been to many in the States.  Only problem now is whether my favorite Ethiopian restaurants in Seattle will still taste as good!  Highly, highly recommended.",review,84XhBgCd2yi1OMuKp934zA,2,2,1

I have also had the chili relleno and it is the best I have tasted as well leaving me to wonder with the single review you have for anything, why the venom?I learned long ago to ask for what is recommended for before you order and if someone recommends a place try what they are harping about first. When I asked they said the chili relleno, pork, empanadas, and red sangrias. Guess how my dining experience went? Try ordering tacos from Los Dos Molinos and you will leave pissed. Order the green chili pork and you will drive 100 miles for it.I do hope you give it another chance I have honestly never had anything sub par here in my 7 or so visits and they seriously could charge way more for quality than they do.  I agree that Main Ingredient is great also, that's why I took the time to write about it. But to reiterate:11-13 dollar for most dinner items besides new york strip(on the list to try), is not priceyhappy hour has most items for 4-6$street tacos are not bursting with meatask what is the best thing on the menu when you order some place then you can write it off all you want.Humble Pie  was more pricey and not worth it, All it does is take up parking from a much better place next door. For a place with the reference to pizza in it's name you would think it would be better, it tasted like peter piper.I would love to know what a good chicken taco is in your opinion, I cant think of any besides maybe the California tacos at the now closed Chuy's, but the ones my sister ordered from here were full of chicken and topped with a nice chipotle/ranch like sauce which is similar.",review,9g_ARKx0eJmNH8oO1TR9rQ,0,0,1

My friends and I probably averaged twice a week, and there were likely weeks when we were there more. The atmosphere is really wonderful, a rarity in Phoenix. The food is very consistent and almost everything on the menu is unique and flavorful. I must agree with some of the other reviews, that the waitstaff is very hit-or-miss. I've had wonderful service and terrible service, and there are times when I've had to go and ask the bartender to send someone over to our table to take our order... as regulars, in particular, I wouldn't think that this would be something we would have to deal with. That being said, there was one time when they were understaffed and the manager was very apologetic and even sent us a bunch of appetizers free of charge as an apology... so I haven't personally experienced the attitude that others report. I miss Fez... now I live in San Diego. When I go to visit, it's always on the itinerary, every time, usually as soon as I land.",review,TLj3XaclA7V4ldJ5yNP-9Q,1,1,0
iDYzGVIF1TDWdjHNgNjCVw,10/30/12,qaNZyCUJA6Yp0mvPBCknPQ,5,"Why did I wait so long to try this neighborhood hot spot!  Having a father who grew up on Los Olivos I remained a loyal customer, that is, until last evening's change in plans lured me to the colorfully lit and lively patio of Los Sombreros Authentic Mexican Cafe & Cantina.  I am not an expert on ""authentic"" Mexican cuisine nor will I pretend to know what  the flavors of San Miguel de Allende taste like; however, I am a foodie so I know good food when I eat it.  We chose to sit outdoor and enjoy the beautiful weather while taking in another Cardinal's loss!  (Sad, I know, since they were off to a great start)....  Lucky for us it was a calm Monday night and we had the full attention of our waiter, aka the bartender.  Phil (no need to blush if you read this) did a wonderful job walking us through their many margarita selections while also conveying his personal favorites that showcased his love for whiskey!  My friend allowed Phil to make his margarita as he felt a fine margarita should be made while I allowed Phil to concoct my special margarita while following strict no sugar, no salt, heavy on the tequila preferences...and that was just to start!  Perfectly crafted margaritas in hand, check.  Now what to eat for dinner.  My friend ordered his beloved Mole poblano ($18.95) while I couldn't decide between the Smoked chicken enchiladas with salsa verde and chipotle crema (yumm) and the Pollo a la parilla with spinach in a chipotle cream sauce -or- tinga Poblana sauce($18.95).  I opted for the Pollo a la parilla with chipotle cream preparation and, once again, my dinner friend had 'order envy'!!  That's not to say his Mole was par (or dare I say sub-par) because it wasn't - it actually has received many culinary awards being named ""Best Mole"" both locally and nationally, but because the chipotle cream sauce combined with spinach, perfectly saut̩ed  chicken breasts and a side of warm corn tortilla is....AMAZZZZZZING!!!!  It's also fair that I note aside from the pricier entree dishes served w two sides (as we ordered), they also offer up tacos (3 at $10.95), various quesadillas (@ $5.95) and other lesser priced authentic eats including fresh guacamole, salads and more!  Deciding I'd save room to see if they could satisfy my sweet tooth I boxed my remaining dinner as we read through each and every dessert.  Undecided, again, and so we trusted our gastronomy guide, Phil, to choose.  He selected the Mexican Chocolate Cream Pie to finish off the evening, and we happily finished off this delectable treat leaving one bite as I always like to do!!!   Thank you, Phil and Los Sombreros, for the memorable dining experience.  The food was outstanding, margaritas made by Phil are the best, and the patio alone is enough to draw me back for HH or even a late night dessert.  Thank you for staying in the neighborhood, Azucena Tovar, and congrats on almost turning 20 years old.",review,Id-8-NMEKxeXBR44eUdDeA,3,6,3

I felt it was necessary in this case.  My husband and I came here over the weekend after a lovely trip to the dog park.  The two guys working here on the lonely afternoon were awesome.  They were really nice and friendly, and quite chatty.  One of them started helping my husband and the other one was sweeping while I was deciding.  The sweeping boy apparently noticed I was ready and he quickly ran to the back, washed his hands, threw on gloves and asked me what I wanted.  WOW!  This type of service has never happened at the other locations, all of which I have been too.  He chatted with me as I told him what I wanted.  He also joked about my weird sandwich and made me laugh.  It's refreshing to see a couple guys working on a boring day and actually enjoying themselves.  They also have outdoor seating which are perfect to sit at and people watch on beautiful days.  We even met this incredible 90 year old guy who is blind and deaf in both ears but somehow managed to communicate with us perfectly.  He was much more lively than most twenty-somethings you meet.
